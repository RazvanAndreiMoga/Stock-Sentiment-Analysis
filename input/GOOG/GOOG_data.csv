As part of part of Yahoo Finance's exclusive coverage from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman and Brian Sozzi spoke to preeminent leaders and top executives across the industry about advancements in AI and expectations for the coming year. The advancements in artificial intelligence, generative AI in particular, have had a major impact on the work of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. ""I found it's a real productivity increase,"" former Microsoft (MSFT) President and CEO Bill Gates explained. ""Likewise, for coders, you're seeing 40, 50% productivity improvement, which means you can get programs sooner. You can make them higher quality, make them better."" Nasdaq (NDAQ) CEO and President Adena Friedman broke down the impact of AI on new companies entering the market. Friedman said, ""Very exciting time, I have to say, because every company can benefit from this next generation of technology. I think you can look at every industry and gen AI has applicability. So companies that help unlock that potential are going to be, I think, companies that a lot of investors are looking at."" Bank of America (BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan provided his thoughts on AI applications. Moynihan said, ""We completely believe that this will have a big impact ... you have to have the ability to convert processes to technique through language models and learning models. The trick in that is that we have to have accountability."" The popularity of generative AI will impact companies like Verizon Communications (VZ), which controls the wireless networks which will transmit so much of this data. Verizon Chairman and CEO Hans Vestberg said, ""I think at the edge of the network it's going to be very important to have AI to take quick decisions very close to the end views of the customer or the enterprise. And of course that's how we build our network."" Novartis (NVS) recently announced a partnership with Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and also has an existing partnership with Microsoft, which leverages its AI platform. Novartis CEO Vasant Narasimhan explained, ""We developed an approach called generative chemistry to try to speed up how fast we can bring new medicines into the clinic ... it's really opening up new horizons.""

Tech giants including Meta (META) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) are taking the lead and could very easily swallow the smaller stakeholders in the sector, specifically in the monetization of data. Nomad Data CEO Brad Schneider discusses how AI will turn data into dollars. Schneider notes that social and online media sites will instrument the first wave of data monetization, which involves training large language models, while the second wave focuses on more specific, “narrower” models that serve single functions. Large tech companies are ""the most data-hungry ones today,” Schneider explains, saying they are ""building the tools"" of the so-called AI revolution. Schneider goes on to say smaller companies will be able to innovate AI faster. For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.

Fernandez explains that stocks like the tech giants have already priced in anticipated gains from areas like AI monetization. This helps explain disappointing results from names like Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) recently. Of the tech titans, she sees Apple (AAPL) as most worrisome for investors, since it has been ""down versus the rest of that Magnificent Seven for a while,"" and faces a ""tricky"" path to meet forecasts. Given high valuations, Fernandez notes she has been ""trimming"" tech holdings, advising investors not to ""go all in"" on those stocks. However, she singles out Microsoft as a top tech pick thanks to strengths in AI, cash flow, and balance sheet. Watch the video above to hear what Fernandez has to say about investing in Amazon.

Yahoo Finance spoke to executives, experts, and analysts across the industry to break down everything investors need to know, including the winners and losers from this week's results. Yahoo Finance Markets Reporter Josh Schafer broke down the big earnings week ahead and what to expect from these mega-cap tech companies. Schafer said, ""Really, you're only missing Nvidia in terms of massive tech companies to report this week. And really I think the story here is understanding how big this is going to be for the overall market."" GM (00:00:14) General Motors (GM) reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter results. General Motors CFO Paul Jacobson discussed the results, EV adoption, and the company's growth plans. Jacobson said, ""It was another year of overcoming a lot of challenges. As we think about 2024, it really is a year of execution. For us, we've got the roadmap. We talked about 200,000 to 300,000 EVs being produced this year."" Alphabet (00:00:36) Alphabet reported better-than-expected revenue and profit, but ad revenue came in weaker than analyst estimates of $65.94 billion. Baird Technology Desk Sector Strategist Ted Mortonson provided insight into the results and the impacts of AI on Google and other tech companies. Mortonson said, ""People are really focused on this move to generative AI and that seems to be a very big focus longer term for The Street, where Google has had basically a monopoly on search. With generative AI, you've got different players at least trying to dethrone them in some way."" Microsoft (00:00:52) Microsoft's fiscal second-quarter earnings beat estimates, but Wall Street supposedly expected more from AI-driven revenue streams. Brent Bracelin, Piper Sandler Equity Research Analyst on Cloud, discussed the results and outlook for future revenues as generative AI turns roughly one-year-old in its adoption by tech giants. Bracelin said, ""Generative AI is one-year-old. We're one year into this new AI cycle of Microsoft. They disclosed their AI business actually doubled sequentially. It's now a $4.4 billion run rate business in year one."" Starbucks (00:01:10) Starbucks (SBUX) released its latest quarterly earnings with results missing revenue expectations despite growing over 8% year-over-year. In addition, the company is cutting its original full-year guidance for 2024. Starbucks CFO Rachel Ruggeri discussed the latest earnings report, what the company plans to change, and ongoing headwinds for the company. Ruggeri said, ""We had a strong quarter in Q1, and it was really driven by our most loyal customers remaining engaged across the globe. And so as we think about going forward ... what we're really focused on is continuing to drive customers into our rewards program."" Boeing (00:01:29) Boeing (BA) narrowed its fourth-quarter losses as outlined in its latest earnings results, but is withholding 2024 guidance amid questions surrounding the manufacturing of its 737 Max 9 jet series. Melius Research Managing Director of Aerospace, Defense & Space Robert Spingarn broke down the implications for Boeing. Spingarn said, ""The fact that there's no guide here isn't really a suspension so far as I can tell ... The FAA has asked for a freeze on the 737, arguably the most important product they do. And I think they're just being smart and not trying to get ahead of the regulator."" Novo Nordisk (00:01:47) Novo Nordisk (NVO) reported a 36% surge in sales thanks to high demand for weight loss drugs Wegovy and Ozempic. Novo Nordisk CFO Karsten Munk Knudsen discussed the company’s results and what it has in store in the coming months. Knudsen said, ""We are really happy and very proud about the results we delivered this morning. Being able to grow the company by 36% is historic in our context and in an industrial context."" Qualcomm (00:02:08) Qualcomm (QCOM) posted its first-quarter earnings results, revealing a quarterly revenue of $9.94 billion, $6.69 billion of which came from its handsets division, a 16% increase year-over-year. Qualcomm Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer Akash Palkhiwala discussed the chipmaker's performance, the current transition to AI-based tech, and China's economic environment. Palkhiwala said, ""When people buy a new phone, they're buying a more expensive phone. And so we are seeing this tremendous make shift towards more expensive devices, towards more expensive chips. And that shows up in our revenue growth."" Meta (00:02:21) Meta Platforms outpaced Wall Street estimates for its fourth-quarter earnings, posting $40.1 billion in revenue and earnings of $5.33 per share. Seaport Global Analyst Aaron Kessler discussed Meta's earnings and its guidance around pivots into AI. Kessler said, ""Obviously investors are going to like that showing continued expense discipline on their part. And so I think investors are really more focused on the guidance and the dividend for Meta."" Amazon (00:02:36) Amazon reported its fourth-quarter earnings, beating Wall Street estimates with $170 billion in revenue versus an expected $166.2 billion. Wedbush Securities Managing Director Scott Devitt broke down the results and the performance of the online retailer's various segments and business properties. Devitt said, ""At $13.2 billion, which is what they did in the quarter, you have a trajectory that's leading the company towards kind of a 10% bogey in 2025 now, which is not something that investors were expecting."" Apple (00:02:50) Apple's first-quarter earnings results blew past Wall Street estimates, posting over $119.5 billion in revenue and adjusted earnings per share of $2.18. However, net sales across Apple's categories and devices fell below expectations, particularly in its services and performance in China. Manhattan Venture Partners Head of Research Santosh Rao discussed Apple's sales miss and how Apple will proceed in generative AI investments. Rao said, ""The number is a miss overall, but I think it's not a major disaster because it's all about the future here going forward, how they get the generative AI into their whole mix and all that. So there are a lot of other levers that they can pull, but at this point it is definitely a disappointment that two areas that we were concerned about did disappoint.""",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=21382b94e15f34226a0b907b7175103a5fe8e080a9bef2ded477a654f8134813

And with the earnings season already showing continued AI investment across the tech industry, Nvidia stands to continue to gain considerably. #2 Market Expectations - Expectations for Nvidia’s fourth quarter are sky high after the company stunned Wall Street in the prior period when revenue rocked an incredible 206% year-over-year to $18.12 billion. In the fourth quarter, the company is projecting revenue of $20 billion plus or minus 2%, well above analysts’ prior expectations of $17.8 billion. And Wall Street doesn’t see the growth stopping anytime soon. Bank of America recently raised its price target on Nvidia price target to $800 from $700. Goldman Sachs also raised its target for the company to $800. It previously had a price target of $625 on the stock. #3 Regulation & Competition: Still, it’s not all smooth sailing for Nvidia. The company is contending with U.S. export restrictions blocking the sale of some of its high-end chips to China, one of its largest markets. And while that isn’t hurting the company for now, it could mean the chip giant misses out on potential future sales. Then there are its rivals: AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC) are slowly but surely building out their own high-powered AI chips, with AMD, in particular, gaining on Nvidia’s tail. That company says its latest MI300X chip can go toe-to-toe with Nvidia’s H100, a claim Nvidia refuted via a blog post. Nvidia’s own customers including Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and Tesla (TSLA) are also building out their own AI chips, which could cut into the total addressable market for third-party AI chips. Still, those threats are relatively distant at this point. Nvidia is still riding high at the moment. And we’ll find out it can keep the hype train rolling when it reports its results Feb. 21.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=e57129573f198a75a8e82521ef098cc2151fba041fbf7e64124d6a113c5d27d6

In 2023, the company generated nearly $27 billion in revenue, and its market value is well over $1 trillion. Let's take a closer look at what led to Nvidia's boom with Beyond the Ticker, where we dive into the company's biggest moments. 1993 Nvidia was founded on April 5, 1993, by Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem, with a vision to bring 3D graphics to the gaming industry. 1997 Nvidia launched its first hit product, the NV3. It would later go on to sell a whopping 1 million units in its first four months of availability. 1999 On January 22, 1999, Nvidia went public via IPO at $12 per share. 2000 Microsoft (MSFT) chose Nvidia to develop the graphics hardware for the first Xbox console. 2005 Microsoft rival Sony (SONY) chose Nvidia’s hardware to power the PlayStation 3. 2010 Nvidia became the graphics chip supplier for automaker Audi. 2015 The company launched its Nvidia Drive chip for powering driver assistance systems. 2016 Nvidia kicked off its AI efforts with the launch of its DGX-1 server for artificial intelligence applications. 2018 The company debuted the NVIDIA RTX, the first GPU capable of real-time ray tracing. That same year, Google (GOOG, GOOGL) announced it was using Nvidia’s Tesla (TSLA) P4 graphics cards for its Google Cloud Platform. 2022 Nvidia debuted its H100 graphics chip for AI, which still stands as one of the world’s most powerful chips for artificial intelligence apps. 2023 In May 2023, Nvidia eclipsed the $1 trillion market cap mark, joining the ranks of mega companies like Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft. The stock continues to surpass its all-time highs over the past month and is currently trading at over $700 per share. From a company of three engineers working on a graphics card, to thousands of employees working on chips that will power the AI supercomputers of the future, Nvidia remains at the top of the tech industry. From tech giants to retail titans, Beyond the Ticker is a historical series that takes a deep dive into some of Wall Street's trending companies and how they transformed into the financial icons they are today.

This stems from concerns over state laws enacted by Florida and Texas that would stop social media platforms from supposedly suppressing certain political content. The ruling may have major implications for how state governments may regulate how social media platforms moderate their content. Sinan Aral, Author of The Hype Machine and Professor at MIT Sloan Management, joins Yahoo Finance to discuss the social media case before the Supreme Court, how it may play out, and the implications of its potential rulings. When asked how the Supreme Court may lean, Aral says: ""I think the justices are skeptical of these laws. I don't imagine that these two laws are going to be upheld in their entirety. I think that either they're going to be overturned or the cases are going to be remanded for further development in the lower courts. And the reason why that would happen is precisely the threading the needle that I discussed earlier, which is that the Supreme Court is likely to want to bound the impact of their decision... You saw them asking questions about exactly what are the boundaries of the scope of these laws and therefore their decisions about these laws. At the end of the day, it's going to be about content moderation and how much of it is the purview of social media companies or not.""

However, their dominant run may be ending, according to JonesTrading Chief Market Strategist Mike O'Rourke. O'Rourke pointed to recent earnings from Meta (META) and Nvidia (NVDA) that ""shattered"" expectations yet saw different market reactions. He notes the Magnificent Seven valuations have diverged ""drastically,"" causing investors to ""differentiate"" between them rather than treat them as a uniform group. As growth moderates for these mega-cap stocks, O'Rourke expects ""rotation"" within the Magnificent Seven tech companies as investors compare valuations and future trajectories. He believes this could force funds into other promising areas of the market beyond the narrow mega-cap technology focus, like biotech and pharma.

But are there opportunities in the sector for other companies to make an intervention? Constellation Research founder and analyst R ""Ray"" Wang and TD Cowen managing director and senior equity research analyst John Blackledge join the Live show to discuss the future of the Magnificent Seven tech stocks and what investors need to keep in mind with so many possibilities in the sector. While Apple (AAPL) has made forays into generative AI, investors say they want more. Wang, however, sees existing potential, such as the expansion of Apple Ferret, an open-source machine learning model, and Apple chips with built-in AI. He signals that the recent regulations levied against Apple rom the Europe Union might affect AI stocks moving forward: ""The challenge with AI and regulatory bodies is this is the opportunity for an aspiring politician to save the world and help us with privacy and stop big tech. And without understanding the cost/benefit analysis of what they're going up against. So you are going to see a lot more regulatory pressure and headwinds that are going to affect a lot of these tech companies, especially as government wants to get involved in the regulatory aspect of AI because tech is one of the few industries that is so lightly regulated compared to everything else."" Blackledge elaborates on the nature of competition between tech companies in their pursuit of generative AI: ""Microsoft (MSFT) and OpenAI clearly won the headline battle last year for sure. Alphabet (GOOG,GOOGL), as far as I was tracking, right, probably in February, March, start to go faster with it. They had some good announcements in IO last year, last May. Obviously we're talking about the Gemini launch and it is going to be a little bit uneven but I do believe it's there for them to do well and to benefit like I was saying earlier with their cloud business, for enterprises and small business, and then with their Gemini suite of products for consumers. I agree, we've heard from all of our companies have reported. They're all using generative AI across their companies for internal functions and what not. We think Alphabet will be there for it.

Aguilar highlights a notable shift in the mega-cap tech sector, transitioning from being ""a momentum trade to a fundamental trade"" due to fading AI hype. He emphasizes that for these companies to deliver on future expectations, they will require significant capital expenditure and research and development investments. As expectations for these stocks remain elevated, ""investors are questioning"" whether the current levels of gains can be sustained over the long term. With the highly anticipated Consumer Price Index (CPI) data set for release Tuesday, Aguilar advises investors to ""expect more volatility."" However, he suggests that investors should view this volatility as an opportunity to rebalance their portfolios and strategically position themselves for evolving market conditions.

Canaccord Genuity LLC Managing Director George Gianarikas joins Yahoo Finance to highlight how Tesla could turn its lagging performance around and remain a worthwhile opportunity for investors. Gianarikas notes that for Tesla's stock to experience a turnaround, several developments must emerge from the automaker's record research and development spending: ""First, the next generation vehicle has to start to ramp, or people have to gain confidence that it's going to ramp and be successful. Second, their margins need to go up. The most likely lever for that happening is the increase of FSD, full self-driving penetration, which leverages the AI they built, in addition to volume starting to pick up.

Macquarie Senior Media Tech Analyst Tim Nollen joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss how AI can help advertising companies optimize their budgets. Nollen acknowledges that AI ""has been a factor for many years already"" in the advertising and media landscape. However, he also highlights the ""broader implications"" of language models like ChatGPT, which could fundamentally change how consumers perform searches. This shift could substantially impact search market revenue, which is already a $200 billion industry, Nollen explains. He notes AI could open up opportunities for advertisers who allocate ad spending to search engines, allowing them to diversify their budgets and explore alternative avenues.

Evercore ISI Analyst Amit Daryanani — who has an Outperform rating on the stock with a price target of $220 per share — joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss how Apple could potentially recover and get unstuck from the rock-and a-hard place the iPhone maker finds itself in the middle of. Daryanani notes that the EU probe poses ""more headline risk than fundamental risk,"" stating that he doesn't believe it has ""a material impact"" on Apple. However, he suggests that how ""elements in the US play out"" will have a more substantial financial impact on Apple, as investors await the fallout from the DOJ investigation and the broader implications of Apple's AI partnership with Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL). Regarding Apple's stock underperformance, Daryanani attributes it to the fact that the company is not being perceived as ""an AI story."" He anticipates that at its upcoming WWDC 2024 conference, Apple will likely discuss the inclusion of Google's Gemini AI on iPhones and how AI can enhance the iPhone experience, which could serve as a good ""value [proposition]"" for the company's stock.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) is closing the quarter at a new record high, marking the best first quarter since 2019.
