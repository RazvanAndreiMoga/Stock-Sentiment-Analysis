Here are some of the highlights. Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan (00:00:03) Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan (BAC) explains why he thinks we will see a soft landing. “What a soft landing is, you don’t go negative in GDP growth on a quarterly basis… So now [our team’s] basic view is we drop from the growth rate in the third quarter 4 plus, down to 1 percent annualized GDP growth for the first three quarters. That is a soft landing. It didn’t go negative, but it landed and got near zero… That’s the prediction… And that’s largely due to the consumer,” Moynihan says. Guggenheim Partners Investment Management CIO & Managing Partner Anne Walsh (00:00:43) Guggenheim Partners Investment Management CIO and Managing Partner Anne Walsh discusses why she believes we will see “a mild recession.” “We’ve seen the yield curve being inverted for 300 plus days is a precursor to recession historically. And our view is, is that we are going to see a mild recession… just a good old-fashioned slowdown in business,” Walsh explains. “We’re just a little bit more concerned that the economy will slow down more than that soft landing view.” Walsh adds that she thinks of “the economy as almost two economies now.” “There’s the big companies, the big market participants, they all seem to be doing pretty well. They’re coming into this slowdown cycle with a tailwind... However, the small and midsize businesses in the U.S.,” Walsh explains, “that’s a different story. They’re going to be having to refinance as a refinancing wall in coming with commercial industrial loans, particularly in small and midsize banks.” Stifel Financial CEO Ron Kruszewski (00:02:02) Stifel Financial CEO Ron Kruszewski (SF) discusses expectations for rate cuts from the Federal Reserve in 2024. “The Fed will cut less than the market thinks and not as soon as the market thinks,” Kruszewski notes. “The definition of a soft landing would be that the Fed could cut while the economy’s strong. But the reason I tapped those expectations down a little bit, is that the Fed really was concerned about inflation… And I don’t see the Fed just saying ‘oh we’ve solved the problem’ by March.” Kruszewski adds that “a hard landing starts with a soft landing.” Harvard University Professor of Economics Kenneth Rogoff (00:02:47) Kenneth Rogoff, Maurits C. Boas Chair of International Economics at Harvard University, explains why “the Fed just doesn’t know what it’s looking for.” The Federal Reserve “wants to find a path of interests rates so that inflation’s stable. They don’t know what it is and they’re going to feel it out,” Rogoff says.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=53c83ff1c745525920416ee2b6385bbe140a66284d43dfa04e76be7ecf54905a

As part of part of Yahoo Finance's exclusive coverage from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman and Brian Sozzi spoke to preeminent leaders and top executives across the industry about advancements in AI and expectations for the coming year. The advancements in artificial intelligence, generative AI in particular, have had a major impact on the work of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. ""I found it's a real productivity increase,"" former Microsoft (MSFT) President and CEO Bill Gates explained. ""Likewise, for coders, you're seeing 40, 50% productivity improvement, which means you can get programs sooner. You can make them higher quality, make them better."" Nasdaq (NDAQ) CEO and President Adena Friedman broke down the impact of AI on new companies entering the market. Friedman said, ""Very exciting time, I have to say, because every company can benefit from this next generation of technology. I think you can look at every industry and gen AI has applicability. So companies that help unlock that potential are going to be, I think, companies that a lot of investors are looking at."" Bank of America (BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan provided his thoughts on AI applications. Moynihan said, ""We completely believe that this will have a big impact ... you have to have the ability to convert processes to technique through language models and learning models. The trick in that is that we have to have accountability."" The popularity of generative AI will impact companies like Verizon Communications (VZ), which controls the wireless networks which will transmit so much of this data. Verizon Chairman and CEO Hans Vestberg said, ""I think at the edge of the network it's going to be very important to have AI to take quick decisions very close to the end views of the customer or the enterprise. And of course that's how we build our network."" Novartis (NVS) recently announced a partnership with Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and also has an existing partnership with Microsoft, which leverages its AI platform. Novartis CEO Vasant Narasimhan explained, ""We developed an approach called generative chemistry to try to speed up how fast we can bring new medicines into the clinic ... it's really opening up new horizons."" Cisco (CSCO) CEO Chuck Robbins discussed the trajectory of AI and the impact it will have across the industry. Robbins said, ""I think the ones that are going to win are the ones that figure out how do I create value based capabilities that help end users take advantage of the data they have."" Salesforce (CRM) CEO Marc Benioff believes that we will one day have AI employees, but we are not there yet. Benioff said, ""There's no question that where AI is going is digital employees ... in today's world that's not where AI is. We know that AI has got a lot of problems still."" Qualcomm (QCOM) CEO Cristiano Amon broke down the state of the semiconductor sector given the surge in AI demand. Amon explained, ""It's so exciting we did something that is very unique. We can run those large language models on your phone, and you can do them very fast."" Microsoft has plans to expand its AI capabilities. Microsoft Vice Chair and President Brad Smith said, ""I think this is one technology that will live up to the impact that people expect ... it is quite possibly the defining technology of our lifetime, certainly this decade I think without question."" C3.ai (AI) Founder, Chairman, and CEO Tom Siebel discussed his expectations for AI products as more companies pivot into the space. Siebel said, ""Generative AI changes everything. It fundamentally changes the nature of the human-computer interface as it relates to enterprise application software, and this is big."" Williams-Sonoma (WSM) is utilizing AI in its email marketing as well as its supply chain optimization. Williams-Sonoma CEO Laura Alber explained, ""We're seeing great benefit on the supply chain side being optimized. And we can optimize it for time, or we can optimize it for cost."" Grammy Award-winning musician and entrepreneur will.i.am announced a new radio show he will be co-hosting with an AI co-host. Will.i.am explained, ""It's trained on the world's information ... and I think that's the way to really educate people on where we are.""

In response, Powell signaled the rules would undergo a broad overhaul. Chris Whalen, Chairman of Whalen Global Advisers, joins Yahoo Finance to discuss what changes to expect to Basel III.  Whalen highlights the flaw in Basel's design: ""Basel is a very old construct. It was focused on credit risk originally, if you go back to the beginnings. And over time [the Fed] has tried to expand it to try and cover other kinds of risk. And I think the industry and many others have said, look, you're double counting. You're covering this and you're covering that, and you're really doing the same thing twice. So I'm hoping they're going to rationalize things a little bit and make things simpler.""
