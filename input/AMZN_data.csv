The company released its forecasts for its first quarter 2024 claiming sales will be between $138 billion and $143.5 billion, within Wall Street expectations of $141 billion. Shares of the company began to trend up after the report was released.  Wedbush Securities Managing Director Scott Devitt and Seaport Global Analyst Aaron Kessler join Yahoo Finance to discuss Amazon's earnings results and the performance of the online retailer's various segments and business properties. Kessler points to Amazon's AWS (Amazon Web Services) as a source of success, given its high margin operations and growth, alongside its retail segments: ""Then on the retail side they talk about better regionalization and shipping costs which are reduced because of that. They have gotten really more focused on cost structure within the retail business."" Devitt explains how the different pieces of the company work synergistically, aiding to their success: ""Think of Amazon in five pieces. The retail business is first-party, third-party, and a logistics business. There's an advertising business that's success is driven by the ownership of the marketplace and you have AWS built out of the infrastructure of Amazon. You could get away with AWS being a separate entity, certainly. But when you think about the AI aspects of the business now with the cloud business integrated into that operation, I'm not sure that that's the case either. At a high level, these are all very well-integrated aspects to the business."" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.

This helps explain disappointing results from names like Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) recently. Of the tech titans, she sees Apple (AAPL) as most worrisome for investors, since it has been ""down versus the rest of that Magnificent Seven for a while,"" and faces a ""tricky"" path to meet forecasts. Given high valuations, Fernandez notes she has been ""trimming"" tech holdings, advising investors not to ""go all in"" on those stocks.

Yahoo Finance spoke to executives, experts, and analysts across the industry to break down everything investors need to know, including the winners and losers from this week's results. Yahoo Finance Markets Reporter Josh Schafer broke down the big earnings week ahead and what to expect from these mega-cap tech companies. Schafer said, ""Really, you're only missing Nvidia in terms of massive tech companies to report this week. And really I think the story here is understanding how big this is going to be for the overall market."" GM (00:00:14) General Motors (GM) reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter results. General Motors CFO Paul Jacobson discussed the results, EV adoption, and the company's growth plans. Jacobson said, ""It was another year of overcoming a lot of challenges. As we think about 2024, it really is a year of execution. For us, we've got the roadmap. We talked about 200,000 to 300,000 EVs being produced this year."" Alphabet (00:00:36) Alphabet reported better-than-expected revenue and profit, but ad revenue came in weaker than analyst estimates of $65.94 billion. Baird Technology Desk Sector Strategist Ted Mortonson provided insight into the results and the impacts of AI on Google and other tech companies. Mortonson said, ""People are really focused on this move to generative AI and that seems to be a very big focus longer term for The Street, where Google has had basically a monopoly on search. With generative AI, you've got different players at least trying to dethrone them in some way."" Microsoft (00:00:52) Microsoft's fiscal second-quarter earnings beat estimates, but Wall Street supposedly expected more from AI-driven revenue streams. Brent Bracelin, Piper Sandler Equity Research Analyst on Cloud, discussed the results and outlook for future revenues as generative AI turns roughly one-year-old in its adoption by tech giants. Bracelin said, ""Generative AI is one-year-old. We're one year into this new AI cycle of Microsoft. They disclosed their AI business actually doubled sequentially. It's now a $4.4 billion run rate business in year one."" Starbucks (00:01:10) Starbucks (SBUX) released its latest quarterly earnings with results missing revenue expectations despite growing over 8% year-over-year. In addition, the company is cutting its original full-year guidance for 2024. Starbucks CFO Rachel Ruggeri discussed the latest earnings report, what the company plans to change, and ongoing headwinds for the company. Ruggeri said, ""We had a strong quarter in Q1, and it was really driven by our most loyal customers remaining engaged across the globe. And so as we think about going forward ... what we're really focused on is continuing to drive customers into our rewards program."" Boeing (00:01:29) Boeing (BA) narrowed its fourth-quarter losses as outlined in its latest earnings results, but is withholding 2024 guidance amid questions surrounding the manufacturing of its 737 Max 9 jet series. Melius Research Managing Director of Aerospace, Defense & Space Robert Spingarn broke down the implications for Boeing. Spingarn said, ""The fact that there's no guide here isn't really a suspension so far as I can tell ... The FAA has asked for a freeze on the 737, arguably the most important product they do. And I think they're just being smart and not trying to get ahead of the regulator."" Novo Nordisk (00:01:47) Novo Nordisk (NVO) reported a 36% surge in sales thanks to high demand for weight loss drugs Wegovy and Ozempic. Novo Nordisk CFO Karsten Munk Knudsen discussed the company’s results and what it has in store in the coming months. Knudsen said, ""We are really happy and very proud about the results we delivered this morning. Being able to grow the company by 36% is historic in our context and in an industrial context."" Qualcomm (00:02:08) Qualcomm (QCOM) posted its first-quarter earnings results, revealing a quarterly revenue of $9.94 billion, $6.69 billion of which came from its handsets division, a 16% increase year-over-year. Qualcomm Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer Akash Palkhiwala discussed the chipmaker's performance, the current transition to AI-based tech, and China's economic environment. Palkhiwala said, ""When people buy a new phone, they're buying a more expensive phone. And so we are seeing this tremendous make shift towards more expensive devices, towards more expensive chips. And that shows up in our revenue growth."" Meta (00:02:21) Meta Platforms outpaced Wall Street estimates for its fourth-quarter earnings, posting $40.1 billion in revenue and earnings of $5.33 per share. Seaport Global Analyst Aaron Kessler discussed Meta's earnings and its guidance around pivots into AI. Kessler said, ""Obviously investors are going to like that showing continued expense discipline on their part. And so I think investors are really more focused on the guidance and the dividend for Meta."" Amazon (00:02:36) Amazon reported its fourth-quarter earnings, beating Wall Street estimates with $170 billion in revenue versus an expected $166.2 billion. Wedbush Securities Managing Director Scott Devitt broke down the results and the performance of the online retailer's various segments and business properties. Devitt said, ""At $13.2 billion, which is what they did in the quarter, you have a trajectory that's leading the company towards kind of a 10% bogey in 2025 now, which is not something that investors were expecting."" Apple (00:02:50) Apple's first-quarter earnings results blew past Wall Street estimates, posting over $119.5 billion in revenue and adjusted earnings per share of $2.18. However, net sales across Apple's categories and devices fell below expectations, particularly in its services and performance in China. Manhattan Venture Partners Head of Research Santosh Rao discussed Apple's sales miss and how Apple will proceed in generative AI investments. Rao said, ""The number is a miss overall, but I think it's not a major disaster because it's all about the future here going forward, how they get the generative AI into their whole mix and all that. So there are a lot of other levers that they can pull, but at this point it is definitely a disappointment that two areas that we were concerned about did disappoint.""",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=21382b94e15f34226a0b907b7175103a5fe8e080a9bef2ded477a654f8134813

S&P Dow Jones Indices cited Walmart's (WMT) 3-for-1 stock split as one of the reasons behind the change. S&P Dow Jones Indices Senior Index Analyst Howard Silverblatt joins Yahoo Finance to give insight into the change and what it means for investors everywhere. Silverblatt elaborates on the reasoning for the change: ""S&P does not change the index too often. It's been about 60 changes in 127 years, so change is a major item, a major consideration. At this point, the thinking... is obviously the economy and the markets have changed and we needed additional exposure and Amazon offers that exposure at this point in time. Also, Walgreens has somewhat declined in stock price so since its price-weighted, it doesn't have that much of an impact on there. If you wanted to stay in that field ,you'd have to find a higher priced stock in there. We also had Walmart's 3-for-1 stock split that reduced the weighting within the index. So again, the index needs to stay relevant and reflect the higher end of the US markets.""

Stock performance (00:00:28) The stock is up about 47 percent this year, which made Nvidia surpass both Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) in market cap.

Company revenue (00:00:58) That could be in part due to the company’s revenue – which is expected to triple this quarter to over $20 billion. For context, the company’s full year revenue in 2023 was $27 billion.  The increase is primarily due to data center revenue, which accounts for about 80 percent of Nvidia's sales.

As the S&P 500 (^GSPC) sets new records and ""Magnificent Seven"" trades such as Nvidia (NVDA) sail past red to white hot, remember to keep an even keel, advised life and business strategist Tony Robbins. ""If a Ferrari was on sale for 70% off, you'd buy it. But when your favorite stock is, people freak out. And when the thing is too expensive, they want to buy it,"" Robbins told Yahoo Finance. ""It's the crazy part of humanity."" Long-term fortunes are not built on a single asset class, let alone a single industry. Diversification is key to wealth generation, said Robbins, who has interviewed the likes of billionaires Ray Dalio, Robert Smith, and Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK-A, BRK-B) Warren Buffett. His latest book, ""The Holy Grail of Investing,"" digs into the power of alternative assets in a world obsessed with stocks. ""There [are] 250,000 companies that are from a $100 million to $3 billion [in value] that private equity can step into,"" said Robbins. ""Instead of trying to evaluate [the Magnificent Seven], create the diversification for yourself. So you reduce your risk by 80%."" His other tip for success includes turning a consumer mindset into an investor mindset: Those iPhone upgrades will cost you thousands, but a pile of Apple (AAPL) stock can set you up for the future. And regardless of where you're sitting in life, staying hungry can turn a losing tide — or extend a winning streak. ""If you're hungry, you'll find the answers. If you're hungry, you'll push through,"" said Robbins.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=e227da5b8357eced0d902d8b61e36e9e056eade0d8a9c564090c9d5737ffa139

But are there opportunities in the sector for other companies to make an intervention? Constellation Research founder and analyst R ""Ray"" Wang and TD Cowen managing director and senior equity research analyst John Blackledge join the Live show to discuss the future of the Magnificent Seven tech stocks and what investors need to keep in mind with so many possibilities in the sector. While Apple (AAPL) has made forays into generative AI, investors say they want more. Wang, however, sees existing potential, such as the expansion of Apple Ferret, an open-source machine learning model, and Apple chips with built-in AI. He signals that the recent regulations levied against Apple rom the Europe Union might affect AI stocks moving forward: ""The challenge with AI and regulatory bodies is this is the opportunity for an aspiring politician to save the world and help us with privacy and stop big tech. And without understanding the cost/benefit analysis of what they're going up against. So you are going to see a lot more regulatory pressure and headwinds that are going to affect a lot of these tech companies, especially as government wants to get involved in the regulatory aspect of AI because tech is one of the few industries that is so lightly regulated compared to everything else."" Blackledge elaborates on the nature of competition between tech companies in their pursuit of generative AI: ""Microsoft (MSFT) and OpenAI clearly won the headline battle last year for sure. Alphabet (GOOG,GOOGL), as far as I was tracking, right, probably in February, March, start to go faster with it. They had some good announcements in IO last year, last May. Obviously we're talking about the Gemini launch and it is going to be a little bit uneven but I do believe it's there for them to do well and to benefit like I was saying earlier with their cloud business, for enterprises and small business, and then with their Gemini suite of products for consumers. I agree, we've heard from all of our companies have reported. They're all using generative AI across their companies for internal functions and what not. We think Alphabet will be there for it. The pressure is definitely on."" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.

SkyBridge Founder and Managing Partner Anthony Scaramucci joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss why individuals should consider adding Bitcoin to their portfolios. Scaramucci says Bitcoin is ""something people need to think about"" as a long-term, ""multiple-decade holding,"" comparing it to Berkshire Hathaway as a ""value-store."" He notes those not ""doing the deep dive homework"" on Bitcoin are missing out on its potential benefits. Driving the Bitcoin rally is ""the limited supply"" combined with ""the wild amount of demand,"" Scaramucci explains. With only around 900 new coins mined daily, a number that halves periodically, Scaramucci says ""there's simply not enough"" Bitcoin to meet market appetite. While some are investing due to fear of missing out, Scaramucci believes ""there's another segment"" that understands Bitcoin's ""network effects."" As adoption grows, he sees it becoming ""a form of digital gold,"" advising those caught up in the hype to simply ""stay patient."" Though volatile historically as ""an early adopting technological asset,"" Scaramucci draws parallels to big tech stocks, noting ""we saw Amazon lose 50% of its value eight times."" On politics, Scaramucci argues a second Biden term with restored democratic norms would benefit Bitcoin investors, contrasting another Trump presidency who would likely ""destroy the institutions of democracy.""

Aguilar highlights a notable shift in the mega-cap tech sector, transitioning from being ""a momentum trade to a fundamental trade"" due to fading AI hype. He emphasizes that for these companies to deliver on future expectations, they will require significant capital expenditure and research and development investments.

With the highly anticipated Consumer Price Index (CPI) data set for release Tuesday, Aguilar advises investors to ""expect more volatility.""

Nike's (NKE) slogan and 'Swoosh' logo that defines the iconic brand is now a staple for footwear, athletic apparel, and pop culture. The company generated more than $51 billion in revenue in 2023, an increase of about $4.5 billion year-over-year. Let's take a closer look at Nike's biggest moments with Beyond the Ticker, which charts its path to becoming a global icon. 1964 Nike was originally founded as Blue Ribbon Sports by Phil Knight and Bill Bowerman on January 25, 1964. 1971 The company was renamed Nike and began using the 'Swoosh' logo, created by Portland State University student Carolyn Davis, who sold Nike the logo for just $35. 1980 On December 2, 1980, Nike went public via initial public offering (IPO) on the NASDAQ at $22 per share. 1984 The company signed Michael Jordan, launching the Air Jordan series. Within the first two months of the shoe’s release, Nike sold $70 million worth of Air Jordans. 1997 Nike spun the Jordan brand into its own division featuring the 'Jumpman' logo. 2004 Nike acquired rival Converse for $309 million. Later that year, Phil Knight stepped down as CEO and president of Nike, but continued his chairman role. 2012 Nike became the official supplier for NFL apparel. 2013 Nike became a member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), replacing Alcoa (AA). 2015 The company was named the official supplier for NBA apparel. 2016 Phil Knight officially stepped down from all duties with the company on June 30, 2016. 2019 In November 2019, Nike stopped selling directly through Amazon (AMZN), focusing more on direct relationships with customers. 2021 On November 5, 2021, Nike stock hit an all-time high, trading at $173.12 per share. With the stock down nearly 20% over the past year, as concerns over slowing sales growth and demand in China mount, investors are waiting for the next leg of innovation from the shoe company. From tech giants to retail titans, Beyond the Ticker is a historical series that takes a deep dive into some of Wall Street's trending companies and how they transformed into the financial icons they are today.

So far, Omsom has managed to sell more than 4 million products and is available in more than 2,000 stores, including Whole Foods (AMZN), Target (TGT), and Sprouts (SFM). Pham and her sister, the daughters of Vietnamese refugees, were able to secure investors such as Away Co-founder and CEO Jen Rubio, Zola Co-founder and CEO Shan-Lyn Ma, and food-focused VC firm New Fare Partners Founder Elly Truesdell. At Omsom’s office in Bushwick, Brooklyn, Pham gives Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Brooke DiPalma a literal taste of how she leads her small team to shake up ethnic aisles and change the way consumers eat and think about Asian cuisine. “Omsom is all about being proud and loud, especially when the stereotype of Asian Americans in America's kind of like submissive, or docile,” Pham says. “Omsom is our true kind of energy and ethos and spirit.” Pham details not only how she and her sister have managed to build the brand at such a young age, but also how they were able to launch during the pandemic and endure the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, which held the business’s capital.

The scope of the theft problem is hard to measure, though mentions of organized retail crime rose by 43% on earnings calls in the first half of 2023. To find clarity on this issue, Yahoo Finance explores a first of its kind, AI-driven heat map that could empower retailers to share real-time crime data with each other, and gets an exclusive look at the Department of Homeland Security’s response to the rise in organized retail crime, which they say is about much more than petty shoplifting.
