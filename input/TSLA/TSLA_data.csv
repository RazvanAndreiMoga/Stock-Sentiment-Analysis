While US aviation agencies have made much progress, and US airlines were able to handle the 2023 holiday rush, that could all come to a halt if Congress cannot come to a consensus, or if new regime takes over in 2025 and makes major changes to federal policy. US Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg sits down with Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi to discuss the potential for a government shutdown and the impact it will have for transportation across the US. Buttigieg explains how a shutdown could thwart efforts to expand the number of people working as air traffic controllers, saying it would ""stop us in our tracks."" The Secretary says that preparing for the last shutdown threat ""cost a lot of time, and effort, and energy, and money just getting ready for the possibility of that."" The 2024 race for the White House is starting to heat up. If former President Trump were to win, there is a possibility he could gut some tax credits for EVs. Buttigieg says of that possibility: ""A radical policy shift like that would dramatically undermine the American auto industry, at the very moment when there have been so many gains in a made-in-America EV revolution, under the Biden-Harris administration. The reality is former President Trump allowed China to build a major advantage in EV batteries and EV manufacturing at the very moment when it began to become obvious that EVs are going to be the future and that we can't keep people trapped in gas cars any more than you can keep phone users trapped on land lines for the next hundred years.""

Craig Irwin, ROTH MKM Senior Research Analyst, joins Yahoo Finance to discuss this latest report from the Wall Street Journal and how Elon Musk has shaped the industries he has worked in. Irwin comments on the report : ""I think this has been known to people in government for many years. I first had a conversation with someone in a relevant entity about this more than five years ago and I think that there are several other people that could have been highlighted in that article. It smells like a hit piece. 'Why now?' is the bigger question. You know, it doesn't make a lot of sense to me, given that Tesla's really executing. They're doing a phenomenal job at SpaceX. We could talk about real risks that don't have anything to do with Elon's recreational chemistry.""

What would he want to move Tesla to the ""Lone Star State""? Ann Lipton, Tulane Law Associate Professor joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss what this move could look like for the EV giant—and why Delaware has been a popular state for incorporation. Lipton explains that Delaware became a preferred choice in the early 1900s, and that due to its courts and its offering of “a very up-to-date corporate law that responds to the latest trends,” it has maintained that status. Delaware is unique in that it has a specialized court that hears business disputes only—where only chancellors who are experts preside. This system, according to Lipton allows for “reliable decisions,” in a shorter time. Delaware has been able to create a “network effect,” notes Lipton, who states that precedence has been set to the point that generally outcomes are clear and easier to reach. Acknowledging Nevada as a comparable to Delaware in some ways, Lipton sees it as “attractive” to some, but flexibility and freedom is limited for investors. “Nevada has carved out a little niche for itself,” according to Lipton. Speaking on the process to incorporate in Texas, Lipton expects there would be “some hold ups."" Lipton does not see Musk gaining any wiggle-room apart from the greater possibility of “friendly judges” in Texas, and states that “it's definitely a risky move,” for Musk.

The company’s stock price is on a massive bull run, rocketing 380% since the end of 2022, and was the best performing component of the S&P 500 in 2023. With that said, here are three things we’ll be watching for when the chip giant announces its fourth quarter earnings on Feb. 21. #1 Artificial Intelligence: Nvidia is the tech industry’s go-to provider for the powerful graphics processing units used to train and run generative AI models. Heck, Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that his company will purchase an incredible 350,000 Nvidia H100 cards by the end of 2024 at a price tag well into the billions of dollars. Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Tesla (TSLA), you name it, every company is clamoring for Nvidia’s chips. And those are just the tech giants. Smaller firms are also working to get their mitts on Nvidia’s offerings. And with the earnings season already showing continued AI investment across the tech industry, Nvidia stands to continue to gain considerably. #2 Market Expectations - Expectations for Nvidia’s fourth quarter are sky high after the company stunned Wall Street in the prior period when revenue rocked an incredible 206% year-over-year to $18.12 billion. In the fourth quarter, the company is projecting revenue of $20 billion plus or minus 2%, well above analysts’ prior expectations of $17.8 billion. And Wall Street doesn’t see the growth stopping anytime soon. Bank of America recently raised its price target on Nvidia price target to $800 from $700. Goldman Sachs also raised its target for the company to $800. It previously had a price target of $625 on the stock. #3 Regulation & Competition: Still, it’s not all smooth sailing for Nvidia. The company is contending with U.S. export restrictions blocking the sale of some of its high-end chips to China, one of its largest markets. And while that isn’t hurting the company for now, it could mean the chip giant misses out on potential future sales. Then there are its rivals: AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC) are slowly but surely building out their own high-powered AI chips, with AMD, in particular, gaining on Nvidia’s tail. That company says its latest MI300X chip can go toe-to-toe with Nvidia’s H100, a claim Nvidia refuted via a blog post. Nvidia’s own customers including Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and Tesla (TSLA) are also building out their own AI chips, which could cut into the total addressable market for third-party AI chips. Still, those threats are relatively distant at this point. Nvidia is still riding high at the moment. And we’ll find out it can keep the hype train rolling when it reports its results Feb. 21.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=e57129573f198a75a8e82521ef098cc2151fba041fbf7e64124d6a113c5d27d6

Ark Invest CEO and CIO Cathie Wood, a vocal advocate of bitcoin, joins Yahoo Finance to give her insight into the crypto markets, Coinbase's performance, Ark Invest's bitcoin ETF, ARK 21 shares bitcoin (ARKB), and more. Wood adds the trading platform is ""executing brilliantly."" On Coinbase, Wood claims that it's the ""most compliant exchange out there"" from a regulatory perspective. She also notes that it's competition is fading, especially given the collapse of FTX and the issues Binance has been facing.  Wood gives her view on the future of bitcoin: ""We do five-year plus forecasts, so we're focused on how institutions and countries and companies might use this new asset class for different reasons. So, we think we have just begun from a price appreciation point of view. This is part of a journey. I do believe the SEC giving the green light has encouraged institutions to think carefully about it and have a point of view, so we're in the learning phase right now, and I think over time that this movement into this new asset class will continue to push up the price."" When it comes to Tesla (), Wood says she would support CEO Elon Musk's bid to incorporate the company in Texas, saying a Delaware judge took ""the vote away from us, the shareholder"" who voted in for Musk's sizable pay package.

In 2023, the company generated nearly $27 billion in revenue, and its market value is well over $1 trillion. Let's take a closer look at what led to Nvidia's boom with Beyond the Ticker, where we dive into the company's biggest moments. 1993 Nvidia was founded on April 5, 1993, by Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem, with a vision to bring 3D graphics to the gaming industry. 1997 Nvidia launched its first hit product, the NV3. It would later go on to sell a whopping 1 million units in its first four months of availability. 1999 On January 22, 1999, Nvidia went public via IPO at $12 per share. 2000 Microsoft (MSFT) chose Nvidia to develop the graphics hardware for the first Xbox console. 2005 Microsoft rival Sony (SONY) chose Nvidia’s hardware to power the PlayStation 3. 2010 Nvidia became the graphics chip supplier for automaker Audi. 2015 The company launched its Nvidia Drive chip for powering driver assistance systems. 2016 Nvidia kicked off its AI efforts with the launch of its DGX-1 server for artificial intelligence applications. 2018 The company debuted the NVIDIA RTX, the first GPU capable of real-time ray tracing. That same year, Google (GOOG, GOOGL) announced it was using Nvidia’s Tesla (TSLA) P4 graphics cards for its Google Cloud Platform. 2022 Nvidia debuted its H100 graphics chip for AI, which still stands as one of the world’s most powerful chips for artificial intelligence apps. 2023 In May 2023, Nvidia eclipsed the $1 trillion market cap mark, joining the ranks of mega companies like Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft. The stock continues to surpass its all-time highs over the past month and is currently trading at over $700 per share. From a company of three engineers working on a graphics card, to thousands of employees working on chips that will power the AI supercomputers of the future, Nvidia remains at the top of the tech industry. From tech giants to retail titans, Beyond the Ticker is a historical series that takes a deep dive into some of Wall Street's trending companies and how they transformed into the financial icons they are today.

It's been a wild 2024 so far for the EV maker, with its shares under pressure and Musk's massive $56 billion Tesla pay package struck down by a Delaware court, prompting him to discuss moving the company's incorporation to Texas.  Westly Group Founder and Managing Partner, and former Tesla board member, Steve Westly join Yahoo Finance to discuss Musk, his leadership of Tesla, the company's performance, and why he believes it will have a tough time in 2024. Westly comments on what Musk and Tesla need to focus on for 2024: ""They need to scramble to find the next growth wave, $25,000 car, at least 18 months out, that may be a game changer, might get them back to 30 or 40% growth. What are you going to do in the next 18 months? And I think they've got three shots on goal. They've got the self-driving vehicle with robotaxis. Probably still three five years out. They've got an energy division which most people don't even think about, and that is doing $6 billion last year on the way to maybe $8 or $9 billion this year, growing 50%. That could be a $20 billion division and then they've got the global charging network, because everybody has basically thrown up the white flag, signed a deal with Tesla to be able to use their global charging network.

As the S&P 500 (^GSPC) sets new records and ""Magnificent Seven"" trades such as Nvidia (NVDA) sail past red to white hot, remember to keep an even keel, advised life and business strategist Tony Robbins. ""If a Ferrari was on sale for 70% off, you'd buy it. But when your favorite stock is, people freak out. And when the thing is too expensive, they want to buy it,"" Robbins told Yahoo Finance. ""It's the crazy part of humanity."" Long-term fortunes are not built on a single asset class, let alone a single industry. Diversification is key to wealth generation, said Robbins, who has interviewed the likes of billionaires Ray Dalio, Robert Smith, and Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK-A, BRK-B) Warren Buffett. His latest book, ""The Holy Grail of Investing,"" digs into the power of alternative assets in a world obsessed with stocks. ""There [are] 250,000 companies that are from a $100 million to $3 billion [in value] that private equity can step into,"" said Robbins. ""Instead of trying to evaluate [the Magnificent Seven], create the diversification for yourself. So you reduce your risk by 80%."" His other tip for success includes turning a consumer mindset into an investor mindset: Those iPhone upgrades will cost you thousands, but a pile of Apple (AAPL) stock can set you up for the future. And regardless of where you're sitting in life, staying hungry can turn a losing tide — or extend a winning streak. ""If you're hungry, you'll find the answers. If you're hungry, you'll push through,"" said Robbins.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=e227da5b8357eced0d902d8b61e36e9e056eade0d8a9c564090c9d5737ffa139

Robinson Meyer, Heatmap Founding Executive Editor, joins Yahoo Finance to discuss the landscape of the EV market and the competition between the US market and Chinese automakers.

Aguilar highlights a notable shift in the mega-cap tech sector, transitioning from being ""a momentum trade to a fundamental trade"" due to fading AI hype. He emphasizes that for these companies to deliver on future expectations, they will require significant capital expenditure and research and development investments. As expectations for these stocks remain elevated, ""investors are questioning"" whether the current levels of gains can be sustained over the long term. With the highly anticipated Consumer Price Index (CPI) data set for release Tuesday, Aguilar advises investors to ""expect more volatility."" However, he suggests that investors should view this volatility as an opportunity to rebalance their portfolios and strategically position themselves for evolving market conditions.

Canaccord Genuity LLC Managing Director George Gianarikas joins Yahoo Finance to highlight how Tesla could turn its lagging performance around and remain a worthwhile opportunity for investors. Gianarikas notes that for Tesla's stock to experience a turnaround, several developments must emerge from the automaker's record research and development spending: ""First, the next generation vehicle has to start to ramp, or people have to gain confidence that it's going to ramp and be successful. Second, their margins need to go up. The most likely lever for that happening is the increase of FSD, full self-driving penetration, which leverages the AI they built, in addition to volume starting to pick up.

""Trust the process,"" Udland advises investors, despite the uncertainty surrounding Federal Reserve rate cuts. Udland points to the continued tech rally and market capital gains as sources of optimism. As heavyweights such as Apple (AAPL) and Tesla (TSLA) experience significant declines, lagging behind other ""Magnificent Seven"" names, Udland identifies Eli Lilly (LLY) and Costco (COST) as potential contenders to replace these stocks. Costco, he highlights, continues to benefit from the premiumization of consumer habits. Udland also stresses the significance of next Wednesday's dot plot release from the Federal Reserve, dubbing it ""the most important dot plot ever."" He explains that current market reactions are based on the expectation of three rate cuts by the Fed. However, this pivotal dot plot will either validate or refute those predictions, shaping market dynamics moving forward.

The last several years now we've been bringing artificial intelligence to that as well, so having a concierge that you could interact with.

""We will be selling more EVs in this country than anyone else, including Tesla,"" Barra told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi in an exclusive interview at GM's technical campus in Michigan.It's a fitting stance for a leader who has overcome a host of issues over her 10 years at the helm of 100-year-old plus GM - by taking a different approach and applying a different vision than others before her. At the time Barra took over as CEO, General Motors was still emerging from its 2009 bankruptcy and reeling from an ignition switch recall that led to over one hundred fatalities. Barra was tasked with completely changing GM's siloed culture and simultaneously changing how the public viewed the company’s cars, as well as regaining their trust. And now she's looking to take GM into a future that she believes includes cars and trucks that run on batteries. Yahoo Finance got the rare opportunity to sit shotgun with Barra in the newly designed E-Ray Corvette to hear how the change-maker CEO intends to make good on her bets to become the leader of electric and autonomous vehicles, despite stiff competition from Tesla (TLSA) and skepticism from shareholders.

At the time Barra took over as CEO, GM was still emerging from its 2009 bankruptcy and reeling from an ignition switch recall that led to over one hundred fatalities. Barra was tasked with completely changing GM's siloed culture and changing how the public viewed the company’s cars, as well as regaining their trust, which she eventually did. Now, contrary to other automakers who are scaling back their immediate plans to convert their car and truck lineups to all-electric in response to slowing consumer demand, she is at it again, this time with GM shareholders. Yahoo Finance’s Executive Editor Brian Sozzi got the rare opportunity to sit shotgun with Barra in the newly designed E-Ray Corvette on GM’s technical campus in Michigan to hear what Barra believes are the most important things the company needs to focus on to win over investors. As well as how she intends to make good on her bets to become the leader of electric and autonomous vehicles despite stiff competition from Tesla (TLSA) and skepticism from shareholders.

At the time Barra took over as CEO, General Motors was still emerging from its 2009 bankruptcy and reeling from an ignition switch recall that led to over one hundred fatalities. Barra was tasked with completely overhauling GM's siloed culture and changing how the public viewed the company’s cars, as well as regaining their trust. ""A crisis is the time you really demonstrate to the entire team that you're going to live your values,"" Barra told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi in a recent exclusive sit-down interview -- as well as a spin in the newly designed E-Ray Corvette on GM’s technical campus in Michigan. Barra shares with Yahoo Finance how she has led GM through crises, as she did when she took over the helm, as well as how she intends to make good on her bets to become the leader of electric and autonomous vehicles despite stiff competition from Tesla (TLSA) and skepticism from shareholders.
