Constellation Research Founder and Principal Analyst R ""Ray"" Wang joins Yahoo Finance to give insight into Apple's AI strategy and share some of the latest tech innovations seen at CES. ""What we've seen over the last couple of quarters is declining revenues but profits are still increasing. That's because the services equation of the rational is actually growing in services a lot more profitable than putting out a piece of hardware,"" Wang says about Apple. ""I would say that we've probably seen those same kind of trends.

But how were they able to achieve such success? Behind The Ticker charts its path from humble beginnings to its transformation into a tech giant. 1976 Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak founded Apple in Los Altos, California. The company's first product, the Apple I, was invented by Wozniak and sold later that year. 1984 Apple launched the Macintosh, announced by a $1.5 million television commercial during Super Bowl XVIII. It was the first mass-market personal computer to feature an integral graphic user interface and mouse. 1985 Steve Jobs left Apple and founded the NeXT computer company. 1991 Apple introduced the Power Macintosh line, utilizing PowerPC processors from Motorola and IBM. It is a design that set the standard for most modern laptops. 1996 Steve Jobs returned after leaving the company over a decade earlier. Apple purchased Jobs' NeXT company for its operating system. Jobs was named interim CEO in 1997 and became CEO again in 2000. 1998 The iMac was introduced, selling almost 800,000 units in its first five months. 2001 Apple announced the opening of a line of Apple retail stores to be located throughout major U.S. markets. The first iPod, storing around 1,000 songs, was introduced later that year. 2007 Apple debuted the iPhone, a revolutionary product that changed the way smartphones look and function. 2011 Steve Jobs suffered from pancreatic cancer. He resigned from his position as CEO just before his death and Tim Cook took over as CEO. 2015 The Apple Watch was launched, the first new product range since the departure of Jobs. 2022 Apple became the world's first publicly traded $3 trillion company. It is currently the largest publicly traded corporation in the world by market capitalization. 2023 Apple unveiled the Vision Pro which is a mixed-reality headset. Its 2024 launch will mark the first product debut in a new major category since the Apple Watch. Apple will launch the Vision Pro on February 2, 2024, in the U.S., with pre-orders starting on January 19.

It came a day after the tech giant reported first quarter results that underwhelmed investors.  D.A. Davidson Managing Director Gil Luria says the Vision Pro ""changes perceptions about Apple's ability to innovate,"" an issue that has arisen given the company hasn't launched a new product category for a few years. Luria thinks the device ""will change how we do computing"" and that ""it's Apple taking us way out into the future."" Luria also explains that future devices will likely resemble glasses more than the large headsets consumers are contending with today. In the earnings report, one sore spot for investors was Apple's China sales. On that point, Luria says there is ""very little visibility"" into China sales, describing the outlook as ""murky."" Luria argues there are a lot of factors that figure into Apple's business in China including the country's weakening economy, the competitive handset market, and a government that can be protectionist.  Watch the video above to hear what Luria has to say about advancements with the iPhone and how Apple may use generative AI.

In 2023, the company generated nearly $27 billion in revenue, and its market value is well over $1 trillion. Let's take a closer look at what led to Nvidia's boom with Beyond the Ticker, where we dive into the company's biggest moments. 1993 Nvidia was founded on April 5, 1993, by Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem, with a vision to bring 3D graphics to the gaming industry. 1997 Nvidia launched its first hit product, the NV3. It would later go on to sell a whopping 1 million units in its first four months of availability. 1999 On January 22, 1999, Nvidia went public via IPO at $12 per share. 2000 Microsoft (MSFT) chose Nvidia to develop the graphics hardware for the first Xbox console. 2005 Microsoft rival Sony (SONY) chose Nvidia’s hardware to power the PlayStation 3. 2010 Nvidia became the graphics chip supplier for automaker Audi. 2015 The company launched its Nvidia Drive chip for powering driver assistance systems. 2016 Nvidia kicked off its AI efforts with the launch of its DGX-1 server for artificial intelligence applications. 2018 The company debuted the NVIDIA RTX, the first GPU capable of real-time ray tracing. That same year, Google (GOOG, GOOGL) announced it was using Nvidia’s Tesla (TSLA) P4 graphics cards for its Google Cloud Platform. 2022 Nvidia debuted its H100 graphics chip for AI, which still stands as one of the world’s most powerful chips for artificial intelligence apps. 2023 In May 2023, Nvidia eclipsed the $1 trillion market cap mark, joining the ranks of mega companies like Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft. The stock continues to surpass its all-time highs over the past month and is currently trading at over $700 per share. From a company of three engineers working on a graphics card, to thousands of employees working on chips that will power the AI supercomputers of the future, Nvidia remains at the top of the tech industry. From tech giants to retail titans, Beyond the Ticker is a historical series that takes a deep dive into some of Wall Street's trending companies and how they transformed into the financial icons they are today.

As the S&P 500 (^GSPC) sets new records and ""Magnificent Seven"" trades such as Nvidia (NVDA) sail past red to white hot, remember to keep an even keel, advised life and business strategist Tony Robbins. ""If a Ferrari was on sale for 70% off, you'd buy it. But when your favorite stock is, people freak out. And when the thing is too expensive, they want to buy it,"" Robbins told Yahoo Finance. ""It's the crazy part of humanity."" Long-term fortunes are not built on a single asset class, let alone a single industry. Diversification is key to wealth generation, said Robbins, who has interviewed the likes of billionaires Ray Dalio, Robert Smith, and Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK-A, BRK-B) Warren Buffett. His latest book, ""The Holy Grail of Investing,"" digs into the power of alternative assets in a world obsessed with stocks. ""There [are] 250,000 companies that are from a $100 million to $3 billion [in value] that private equity can step into,"" said Robbins. ""Instead of trying to evaluate [the Magnificent Seven], create the diversification for yourself. So you reduce your risk by 80%."" His other tip for success includes turning a consumer mindset into an investor mindset: Those iPhone upgrades will cost you thousands, but a pile of Apple (AAPL) stock can set you up for the future. And regardless of where you're sitting in life, staying hungry can turn a losing tide — or extend a winning streak. ""If you're hungry, you'll find the answers. If you're hungry, you'll push through,"" said Robbins.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=e227da5b8357eced0d902d8b61e36e9e056eade0d8a9c564090c9d5737ffa139

Aguilar highlights a notable shift in the mega-cap tech sector, transitioning from being ""a momentum trade to a fundamental trade"" due to fading AI hype. He emphasizes that for these companies to deliver on future expectations, they will require significant capital expenditure and research and development investments. As expectations for these stocks remain elevated, ""investors are questioning"" whether the current levels of gains can be sustained over the long term. With the highly anticipated Consumer Price Index (CPI) data set for release Tuesday, Aguilar advises investors to ""expect more volatility."" However, he suggests that investors should view this volatility as an opportunity to rebalance their portfolios and strategically position themselves for evolving market conditions.

Are these companies doomed to fall from the pack or does the dip represent an opportunity to buy? Canaccord Genuity LLC Managing Director George Gianarikas joins Yahoo Finance to highlight how Tesla could turn its lagging performance around and remain a worthwhile opportunity for investors. Gianarikas notes that for Tesla's stock to experience a turnaround, several developments must emerge from the automaker's record research and development spending: ""First, the next generation vehicle has to start to ramp, or people have to gain confidence that it's going to ramp and be successful. Second, their margins need to go up. The most likely lever for that happening is the increase of FSD, full self-driving penetration, which leverages the AI they built, in addition to volume starting to pick up. Third is continuation in growth. Really good growth in their energy storage business.""

Evercore ISI Analyst Amit Daryanani — who has an Outperform rating on the stock with a price target of $220 per share — joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss how Apple could potentially recover and get unstuck from the rock-and a-hard place the iPhone maker finds itself in the middle of. Daryanani notes that the EU probe poses ""more headline risk than fundamental risk,"" stating that he doesn't believe it has ""a material impact"" on Apple. However, he suggests that how ""elements in the US play out"" will have a more substantial financial impact on Apple, as investors await the fallout from the DOJ investigation and the broader implications of Apple's AI partnership with Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL). Regarding Apple's stock underperformance, Daryanani attributes it to the fact that the company is not being perceived as ""an AI story."" He anticipates that at its upcoming WWDC 2024 conference, Apple will likely discuss the inclusion of Google's Gemini AI on iPhones and how AI can enhance the iPhone experience, which could serve as a good ""value [proposition]"" for the company's stock.

I think that's a strong bull signal. The reality is this is a company that's really only been monetizing for just over a year, predominantly with consumers.

Sixteen US attorneys general are joining the DOJ suit alleging Apple's practice of creating a monopoly in the smartphone and digital app store markets. New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin — who is among the state attorneys general pushing for this case — breaks down the consumer harm Apple's anticompetitive methods have done: ""What we lay out is a pattern that Apple has engaged in of using its market share to restrict and exclude business practices in a way that stifles innovation and makes it harder for consumers to leave the iPhone platform. And as a result of that, it has driven up significantly its own profits and the cost of the products to consumers, so that now in 2024, people are paying over $1,500 for an iPhone, that if you adjust the 2007 price of an iPhone for inflation, it would only be $450.""
