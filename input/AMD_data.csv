Naqi Logix earbuds (00:00:04) Yahoo Finance's Akiko Fujita caught up with Naqi Logix Founder David Segal and Director of Product Management Zavier Alexander, who demonstrated the functionality of Naqi Logix's earbuds. ""This is totally hands-free,"" Alexander said. ""He's just looking at the text that he wants to type, and then it is being typed on screen."" Segal added, ""I'm confident if we can fly a 737 with nothing but an earbud, you can control anything and everything."" AI PCs (00:00:49) Michelle Johnston Holthaus, Intel (INTC) EVP and GM Client Computing Group, discussed the integration of artificial intelligence into devices like PCs. She said, ""It's a game changer because you can take these large language models that have been in cloud, this kind of ambiguous set of experiences that no one tangibly could actually ever touch or hold, and now you've brought it into the CPU."" Qualcomm (00:01:20) Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon (QCOM) discussed company plans to advance on-device AI capabilities in 2024, including automotive applications. Amon said, ""We're working with virtually every company as the car is really becoming a computer on wheels. Digital is becoming the most important part of the automotive transformation."" AI-powered cocktail-making robot (00:01:37) Stephanie Callaway, Doosan Robotics Senior Marketing Manager, demonstrated the AI-powered Mixmaster Moodie, a cocktail-making robot. Utilizing OpenAI's ChatGPT and facial recognition features, the Mixmaster Moodie serves drinks based on the user's mood and voice inflections. Callaway said, ""It takes about 10 seconds ... looking at your face."" Intel (00:02:01) Intel Automotive Vice President and GM Jack Weast discussed Intel's AI chip integration to vehicle systems to create more unique and enhanced user experiences. Weast explained, ""This new line up of products brings the best of the AI PC, and all the reliability of the data centric into the vehicle so automakers can evolve their architecture away from fixed function to software defined and dynamic architectures going forward."" AMD (00:02:25) American semiconductor manufacturer has revealed a slew of new products, including desktop chips aimed at unlocking AI capabilities and improving productivity. The battle for AI PCs has begun as Intel (INTC), Qualcomm (QCOM), and other chip players roll out hardware aimed at AI supremacy. Jason Banta, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Corporate Vice President and General Manager of Client OEM, broke down the features that consumers can expect in the first leg of the AI PC race. ""AI PC is something that we're seeing emerge in the PC market overall. Really what that does is that brings AI capability that typically you see in the cloud or in server devices, you bring that locally into the PC, to perform closer to the user,"" Banta said. ""And that means a lot of things that you see from a generative AI capability ... those things can actually happen local on the device."" Kohler's smart toilets (00:03:00) Andrew Van Gorden, Kohler Product Manager, Smart Toilets, showcased the company's new smart toilet technology. Van Gorden said, ""This is the future of the toilet. This is our Numi 2.0 Smart Toilet. It automatically opens as you walk up to it. A completely touchless experience."" Nvidia (00:03:32) Nvidia (NVDA) announced a partnership with Mercedes-Benz to hone self-driving capabilities. Nvidia Vice President of Automotive Danny Shapiro discussed the company's autonomous driving projects. Shapiro said, ""That's our AI platform for automated driving, driver assistance, all kinds of convenience features. So we're basically bringing the type of AI from the cloud that we're used to seeing, but bringing it right into the car.""

Who’s going to get there first on meaningful regulation? Who are the biggest AI players you haven’t thought of yet? Will legal battles squash innovation, or open it up? Yahoo Finance caught up with experts across the industry to answer these questions and more as part of its weekly series The AI Revolution. Here are some of the best moments. Where are we now? (00:00:05) Yahoo Finance Tech Editor Dan Howley discussed Nvidia's (NVDA) AI advancements, competitors Intel (INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and where the AI race will go moving forward. ""Nvidia is the AI king. They eclipsed the $1 trillion market cap in June,"" Howley said. ""The big ones (rivals) really are AMD, which has been a long-time thorn in their side, and Intel."" Radio Free Mobile Founder Richard Windsor discussed the outlook for generative AI adoption and corporate valuations. Windsor explained, ""There is a big use case for artificial intelligence, yes. It's just not worth the valuations that people are ascribing to them because they think the prices are going to be much higher than they really are."" Finding a referee (00:00:46) Yahoo Finance Legal Reporter Alexis Keenan broke down global AI regulation policies—comparing how different countries are setting up different rules for AI. Keenan said, ""The deep fakes, these are one of the major risks that IP lawyers, tech lawyers talk about ... Also, AI that impacts government infrastructure, that's another big area of concern."" U.S. Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Ca.) is a part of the bipartisan effort introducing the Federal Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Act to Congress, which aims to provide AI regulatory guidelines. Rep. Lieu explained, ""What this bill does is it mandates that the standards set forth by the (National) Institute of Standards and Technology be applied to both the Federal government as well as any companies that want to contract with the Federal government."" Tom Davenport, Babson College President’s Distinguished Professor of Information Technology and Management, discussed the adoption of AI and AI regulation across the globe. Davenport said, ""A lot of potential opportunity. The biggest barrier now is in the data and how organizations get their data ready for generative AI."" Monetizing AI (00:01:37) AI Now Institute Co-Founder and Chief Advisor Meredith Whittaker broke down the recent tech sector layoffs and restructurings that have been fueled by AI. Whittaker said, ""I think what we need is to see increased union density, so workers have more leverage over deciding where AI is introduced and how it's used."" Boosted.ai Co-Founder and CEO Joshua Pantony highlighted the benefits of using generative AI models for investing, and how it is different from past generations of investing programs. Pantony explained, ""If you use a system like ours, you're going to be able to learn information a lot faster. And the other side is really around efficiency of your process."" Legal woes (00:02:14) Ryan Abbott, Brown Neri Smith & Khan, LLP Partner, broke down legal precedents surrounding AI including patent and copyright infringement laws. ""What we're fundamentally seeing is this new sort of activity where you have machines that are behaving like people, and legal systems that were designed with human centric concepts,"" Abbott said. ""A company like Novo Nordisk (NVO) uses AI to develop Wegovy or Ozempic, can they patent something like that, or do you need a traditional human inventor?"" Accenture (ACN) Chief Technology Officer Paul Daugherty discussed AI data and the ways workplace AI may effectively be incorporated into many business models to benefit workers. Daugherty explained, ""There hasn't been anything like generative AI ... it is different. The reason is one, the speed ... the second is this human-like nature of the technology. And as a result of that, it changes everything that people do."" Election risk (00:02:59) Yahoo Finance Senior Columnist Rick Newman broke down how AI will impact the U.S. Presidential election in 2024 and what Americans need to be on the lookout for. Newman said, ""Disinformation in elections is not new ... so I think what's going to be new in 2024 is just the sophistication of the bogus information. It's a lot easier to use AI to do fake videos that look like real people, fake audio recordings."" Generative AI speaker and advisor Nina Schick discussed the political ramifications to come from the AI boom. Schick explained, ""When people start to understand that anything can be synthetic, anything can be AI generated, anything can be faked, they begin to lose trust in everything.

The company also posted adjusted earnings per share of $5.16 versus an expected $4.64 per share. Antoine Chkaiban, New Street Research Technology Infrastructure Analyst, and Dan Morgan, Synovus Trust Senior Portfolio Manager, joins Yahoo Finance to discuss the results. Chkaiban elaborates on the possibilities for Nvidia in the future, along with AI chip making as a whole: ""Global spending on data center AI chips tripled in 2023 from $15 billion to $45 billion and is now set to double again to $90 billion in 2024. And if we look out a few years, well late last year, Lisa Su CEO of AMD (AMD) pitched a target addressable market for data center AI chips of $400 billion in 2027. So now we just need to think about the future along two axis. Either it materializes in a healthy and sustainable way or we fall short of this prediction, with disappointments, over investments, and lower returns."" Speaking to Nvidia's dominance in the space, against their competition, Morgan says: ""I think we have to think of Nvidia as first to market in AI. They have been talking on their conference calls and their product calls for over five years about the fact that they are dominant in the space. And then it came to fruition about a year ago, on this quarter, when they had the big blowout quarter."" He continues by mentioning one the reasons why Nvidia is ahead of competition: ""The average AI chip that Nvidia sells, we don't know the exact price, some of them are like $20,000 or $30,000 apiece. So you kind of wonder if like an AMD who's kind of known as being a lower-priced chipmaker, especially in the CPU area against Intel (INTC), or let's say the data service space, would they come to try to introduce a cheaper chip that maybe people would be willing to go with.""

However, as more investment is poured into AI, some fear the potential for a bubble to form. Citi Head of US Semiconductor Research Chris Danely joins Yahoo Finance to share his perspective about the AI sector's continued room for growth, despite the fact that AI hardware like semiconductors historically experiences cyclical growth. Danely is particularly bullish on semiconductors, sharing his top pick within the sector: ""We've all identified Nvidia as the clear AI leader. I guess in this sort of instantaneous market, they're almost yesterday's news in terms of AI. What we think is going to be the next group of semiconductors or product of semiconductors that's going to have the AI mentioning is going to be memory and specifically DRAM. So, clearly, there's a lot of graphics chips going into it, clearly there's a lot of ethernet chips that Broadcom (AVGO) makes...We think that's the next positive catalyst for the AI market, but you're just starting to see memory come into play as, wow, we need more of this, this is in shortage, and Micron (MU) is the top pick on the DRAM space for us.

While some fear that what goes up must come down, other investors believe these stocks still have room to grow. Mizuho Americas Desk Based Analyst Jordan Klein and KeyBanc Capital Markets Equity Research Analyst John Vinh join Yahoo Finance to discuss how far the momentum can go and which names are best positioned to outperform the broader trend. Vinh explains that while companies such as Marvell Technology (MRVL) and Broadcom (AVGO) recorded increases from AI-related businesses, the gains did not compensate for worse-than-expected performance in other domains: ""Both Marvell and Broadcom reported overnight... their AI businesses grew well over 100% for each of those companies but obviously in the near term we are going through kind of a broader inventory correction, particularly on enterprise, seeing some de-stocking activity there. So obviously in the near term it's obviously not enough to offset some of those sort of headwinds, but I think longer term I think if you are an AI bull we certainly still have conviction in the longer term stories related to these AI names. As investor sentiment on semiconductors begins to resemble a frenzy, Klein relays some of his uneasiness regarding the momentous tech rally: ""I'm uneasy just because of the way the stocks are trading. I'm not uneasy at all about the fundamentals, what some of these companies are saying and doing particularly Nvidia and AMD (AMD) and Broadcom and Marvell or the memory companies or semi-cap equipment. I think there is a real long runway for further growth and upside, but I'm always fearful when you get this fear of missing out kind of chase mentality amongst investors.""

The company reported a revenue of $5.82 billion for the quarter versus an expected $5.33 billion. Micro also issued guidance for its third quarter, estimating $6.6 billion in revenue, beating Wall Street's expectations of $6.02 billion. New Street Research Analyst Rolf Bulk joins Yahoo Finance to discuss the drivers behind Micron's revenue beat and the broader memory space.  Bulk elaborates on the sales forecast for Micron: ""What we see today is that the industry and Micron are being very disciplined when it comes to adding capacity. In memory, it is all about the equation between demand and supply. Micron is being very disciplined there and importantly the same goes for Hynix (000660.KS) and Samsung (005930.KS), the other two major players in memory, so as long as this dynamic persists of the industry being very disciplined when it comes to adding supply and demand steadily recovering, the setup is very strong for the remainder of 2024.""

The move comes as TikTok faces a potential ban in the United States. Founder and Chief Investment Officer at Bokeh Capital Partners Kimberly Forrest joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss why she believes this announcement is a ""tit for tat"" scenario. Forrest notes that China's new policy ""reflects last week's TikTok announcement,"" which she believes is the Chinese government's way of ""matching"" American efforts to regulate some of its most popular products. However, she states that the possibility of either of these announcements being fully implemented is ""very unlikely,"" describing the situation as ""political positioning."" Forrest advises investors to separate the political factors when determining whether to invest in these companies. She emphasizes that what politicians want to happen may not always align with what is actually feasible.
