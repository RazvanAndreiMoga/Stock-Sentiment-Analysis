company,1704479425,Palantir's AI hype 'is ahead of the reality': Analyst,124880972,,MSFT,Yahoo,"Palantir (PLTR) has been hit with a downgrade to ""Underperform"" by Jeffries, which also slashed its price target to $13. The firm argues that Palantir's valuation has become unsustainable on the back of an artificial intelligence boom that has not yet materialized. Jeffries Senior Analyst Brent Thill joins Yahoo Finance to discuss the reason for the move. While acknowledging Palantir has promising technology, Thill believes ""the hype is ahead of the reality."" He notes that while AI adoption will grow, ""AI is a driver, but it's gonna be a slower revenue materialization"" than the market expects for Palantir currently. Thill highlights software firms like Microsoft (MSFT) and Adobe (ADBE) which boast ""the best product line-ups"" spanning multiple sectors, not just an AI niche. For Palantir and similarly hyped names, he advises investors to wait until the AI hype wears off ""and then come back to these names at a lower level."" The downgrade is a reality check that Palantir's value may have become inflated beyond reasonability in anticipation of an AI boom that has yet to emerge.

Here are some of the highlights. Former Microsoft President & CEO Bill Gates (00:00:03) Former Microsoft (MSFT) President and CEO Bill Gates discusses how when there are new technologies, they can be used to achieve both positive and negative things. “AI can be used… for cyberattacks, it can be used to design a bioterrorism weapon…. Whenever we have new technologies, they’re used to achieve positive goals and… for some challenging things as well,” Gates notes. “When we computers, books, video games... we had to think… what’s the tasteful, appropriate use to just get the good and minimize those… negative things.” Nasdaq CEO & President Adena Friedman (00:00:31) Nasdaq (NDAQ) CEO and President Adena Friedman explains that “AI-driven companies, AI-enabled companies, and AI companies themselves, so those companies that can really help transform business, I think that those are the types of companies you’ll see more and more of coming out into the public markets.” Meta Head of Global Business Nicola Mendelsohn (00:00:49) Meta (META) Head of Global Business Nicola Mendelsohn discusses how Meta’s AI products have benefited advertisers. “Back in ’22, we brought together all of the products that we have that are actually powered by AI into our Meta Advantage suite. And what were seeing now, is that our advertisers on the whole are using at least one of those products. And the reason they’re doing that is because it’s giving them better targeting and better performance,” Mendelsohn explains. Verizon Chairman & CEO Hans Vestberg (00:01:14) Verizon (VZ) Chairman and CEO Hans Vestberg notes that “generative AI will be important for our... business.” “When it comes to AI, especially the generative AI and things like that, I think at the edge of the network it’s going to be very important to have AI to take quick decisions, very close to the... end use, to the customer or the enterprise.” Accenture CEO Julie Sweet (00:01:41) Accenture (ACN) CEO Julie Sweet explains “what’s really important is to understand how is the gen AI going to change your talent, what are the new skills, and then… how do you make sure that we can bring people along the journey to get those new jobs.” Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff (00:01:57) Salesforce (CRM) CEO Marc Benioff notes the “exciting opportunities” that come with AI. “I’m trying to tell stories and explain to customers what we’re seeing with AI. And I think that as we have been… traveling around we see so many exciting opportunities with AI that customers are going to get much higher margins,” Benioff says. “Right now AI can really… make people a lot better.” Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins (00:02:16) Cisco (CSCO) CEO Chuck Robbins discusses how AI will impact the company. “I think it’s incredibly early… with AI right now,” Robbins says. “As this AI thing explodes, my expectation is that our infrastructure equipment that goes with it, will also go up. KPMG US Chair & CEO Paul Knopp (00:02:26) KPMG US Chair & CEO Paul Knopp explains that “76 percent of millennials and Gen Z said that generative AI already impacts their professional lives in a big way and that they’re not concerned about job displacement. But I think that really means is they understand the technology and they also know that it’s the future. And that it’s actually mainstream at this point.” “It really is getting to the point where we’re nearing industrialization and a lot of companies are already using it in certain applications of their business,” Knopp adds. Novartis CEO Vasant Narasimhan (00:02:59) Novartis (NVS) CEO Vasant Narasimhan explains how AI will impact the company’s drug development. “Impacting the next five years, is how AI is going to impact many of our productivity efforts in drug development. How fast can we generate new trial protocols, how fast can we work with regulators, how fast can we look at patient safety, look at large patient data sets,” Narasimhan notes. “It is generative AI, but maybe not the most cutting-edge generative AI.” Vista Equity Partners Founder, Chairman, & CEO Robert Smith (00:03:18)  Vista Equity Partners Founder, Chairman, and CEO Robert Smith discusses how AI “is an enabling technology just like other enabling technologies have come and… ultimately been infused into the fabric of... our companies.” “We’ve been… engaging in artificial intelligence for… well over a decade and implementing those in products and solutions and services. Gen AI gives another gear to that,” Smith adds.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=25cdd4a233d65de784a88f14a30ffd3207131120bed7c336d09000ee2e6fceb9

While acknowledging ""there's always a risk of technology being overhyped,"" Smith believes generative AI is truly ""transformational,"" with the power to fundamentally reshape workflows and daily lives for businesses and consumers. By augmenting Microsoft products with AI tools like Copilot, Smith notes the tech giant's aim is to make products ""more useful for people."" Asked about rapid AI advancement, Smith doesn't think it's progressing too quickly, but stresses the need to move forward with ""with safety and innovation at the same speed"" through collaborative governance. ""Of course, there's a risk that in some ways regulation will go too far, there always is,"" Smith says. However, given social media's unchecked rise previously, he argues ""we don't want to do that a second time"" with AI. It's all part of Yahoo Finance's exclusive coverage from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where our team will speak to top decision-makers as well as preeminent leaders in business, finance, and politics about the world’s most pressing issues and priorities for the coming year.

As part of part of Yahoo Finance's exclusive coverage from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman and Brian Sozzi spoke to preeminent leaders and top executives across the industry about advancements in AI and expectations for the coming year. The advancements in artificial intelligence, generative AI in particular, have had a major impact on the work of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. ""I found it's a real productivity increase,"" former Microsoft (MSFT) President and CEO Bill Gates explained. ""Likewise, for coders, you're seeing 40, 50% productivity improvement, which means you can get programs sooner. You can make them higher quality, make them better."" Nasdaq (NDAQ) CEO and President Adena Friedman broke down the impact of AI on new companies entering the market. Friedman said, ""Very exciting time, I have to say, because every company can benefit from this next generation of technology. I think you can look at every industry and gen AI has applicability. So companies that help unlock that potential are going to be, I think, companies that a lot of investors are looking at."" Bank of America (BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan provided his thoughts on AI applications. Moynihan said, ""We completely believe that this will have a big impact ... you have to have the ability to convert processes to technique through language models and learning models. The trick in that is that we have to have accountability."" The popularity of generative AI will impact companies like Verizon Communications (VZ), which controls the wireless networks which will transmit so much of this data. Verizon Chairman and CEO Hans Vestberg said, ""I think at the edge of the network it's going to be very important to have AI to take quick decisions very close to the end views of the customer or the enterprise. And of course that's how we build our network."" Novartis (NVS) recently announced a partnership with Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and also has an existing partnership with Microsoft, which leverages its AI platform. Novartis CEO Vasant Narasimhan explained, ""We developed an approach called generative chemistry to try to speed up how fast we can bring new medicines into the clinic ... it's really opening up new horizons."" Cisco (CSCO) CEO Chuck Robbins discussed the trajectory of AI and the impact it will have across the industry. Robbins said, ""I think the ones that are going to win are the ones that figure out how do I create value based capabilities that help end users take advantage of the data they have."" Salesforce (CRM) CEO Marc Benioff believes that we will one day have AI employees, but we are not there yet. Benioff said, ""There's no question that where AI is going is digital employees ... in today's world that's not where AI is. We know that AI has got a lot of problems still."" Qualcomm (QCOM) CEO Cristiano Amon broke down the state of the semiconductor sector given the surge in AI demand. Amon explained, ""It's so exciting we did something that is very unique. We can run those large language models on your phone, and you can do them very fast."" Microsoft has plans to expand its AI capabilities. Microsoft Vice Chair and President Brad Smith said, ""I think this is one technology that will live up to the impact that people expect ... it is quite possibly the defining technology of our lifetime, certainly this decade I think without question."" C3.ai (AI) Founder, Chairman, and CEO Tom Siebel discussed his expectations for AI products as more companies pivot into the space. Siebel said, ""Generative AI changes everything. It fundamentally changes the nature of the human-computer interface as it relates to enterprise application software, and this is big."" Williams-Sonoma (WSM) is utilizing AI in its email marketing as well as its supply chain optimization. Williams-Sonoma CEO Laura Alber explained, ""We're seeing great benefit on the supply chain side being optimized. And we can optimize it for time, or we can optimize it for cost."" Grammy Award-winning musician and entrepreneur will.i.am announced a new radio show he will be co-hosting with an AI co-host. Will.i.am explained, ""It's trained on the world's information ... and I think that's the way to really educate people on where we are.""

Thanks to that outsized growth, there is a potential that they will continue to maintain their dominance on the S&P 500 (^GSPC). As they hold their dominance, the outcome of their earnings can have major sway over the broader market. Ken Mahoney, CEO of Mahoney Asset Management, joins Yahoo Finance to discuss upcoming earnings from major tech companies and how they could have a sizable impact on the broader market that investors would not want to miss out on. When it comes to expectations for the outcome of potential tech earnings, Mahoney affirms : ""There could be a little sell on the news reaction, but I think the guidance is going to be key. The law of big numbers is incredible, I mean Nvidia as an example, last 12 months has doubled topline revenue, expected to double topline revenue in '24 and '25 and the CEO of Nvidia said 'Hey, we're in the second, third inning.' I hear this all the time. 'Ken, I missed it, I missed it.' Well, the CEO, who is really at the epicenter of all this, is telling you that we're probably in the second or third inning. You might not want to stay around until the ninth or extra innings, but there's a pretty long runway to make some money akin to what we saw in the mid 1990s.

With the advent of AI-powered PCs, questions arise around the impact of Microsoft PC sales and how the company will operate moving forward with this new tech. Ted Mortonson, Baird Technology Desk Sector Strategist, joins Yahoo Finance to give insight into Microsoft's potential with AI-powered PC's and the impact it may have on sales. Mortonson explains Microsoft's advantage with this next generation of tech: ""When you put the gen AI infrastructure into place, and we're doing it right now, I mean, you looked at results like last night with SMCI just absolutely annihilating the number on servers, but as you go forward, we're gonna have to upgrade not only handsets but the PC. We are going to start hearing this term of 'generative IOT devices,' in the '25, '26 time frame, you're going to have to see most PCs being upgraded to have gen AI functionality. What that means is, you're going to have a combination of GPUs, CPUs, and other accelerators on that next generation PC... So, Microsoft is in the pole position to leverage not only through Azure that but, the gen AI PC cycle where every PC in the world will eventually have to be upgraded.""

She believes ""there's going to be some difficulty, I think, in hitting some numbers that continue to make the stocks move higher,"" given lofty expectations. Fernandez explains that stocks like the tech giants have already priced in anticipated gains from areas like AI monetization. This helps explain disappointing results from names like Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) recently. Of the tech titans, she sees Apple (AAPL) as most worrisome for investors, since it has been ""down versus the rest of that Magnificent Seven for a while,"" and faces a ""tricky"" path to meet forecasts. Given high valuations, Fernandez notes she has been ""trimming"" tech holdings, advising investors not to ""go all in"" on those stocks. However, she singles out Microsoft as a top tech pick thanks to strengths in AI, cash flow, and balance sheet. Watch the video above to hear what Fernandez has to say about investing in Amazon.

Yahoo Finance spoke to executives, experts, and analysts across the industry to break down everything investors need to know, including the winners and losers from this week's results. Yahoo Finance Markets Reporter Josh Schafer broke down the big earnings week ahead and what to expect from these mega-cap tech companies. Schafer said, ""Really, you're only missing Nvidia in terms of massive tech companies to report this week. And really I think the story here is understanding how big this is going to be for the overall market."" GM (00:00:14) General Motors (GM) reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter results. General Motors CFO Paul Jacobson discussed the results, EV adoption, and the company's growth plans. Jacobson said, ""It was another year of overcoming a lot of challenges. As we think about 2024, it really is a year of execution. For us, we've got the roadmap. We talked about 200,000 to 300,000 EVs being produced this year."" Alphabet (00:00:36) Alphabet reported better-than-expected revenue and profit, but ad revenue came in weaker than analyst estimates of $65.94 billion. Baird Technology Desk Sector Strategist Ted Mortonson provided insight into the results and the impacts of AI on Google and other tech companies. Mortonson said, ""People are really focused on this move to generative AI and that seems to be a very big focus longer term for The Street, where Google has had basically a monopoly on search. With generative AI, you've got different players at least trying to dethrone them in some way."" Microsoft (00:00:52) Microsoft's fiscal second-quarter earnings beat estimates, but Wall Street supposedly expected more from AI-driven revenue streams. Brent Bracelin, Piper Sandler Equity Research Analyst on Cloud, discussed the results and outlook for future revenues as generative AI turns roughly one-year-old in its adoption by tech giants. Bracelin said, ""Generative AI is one-year-old. We're one year into this new AI cycle of Microsoft. They disclosed their AI business actually doubled sequentially. It's now a $4.4 billion run rate business in year one."" Starbucks (00:01:10) Starbucks (SBUX) released its latest quarterly earnings with results missing revenue expectations despite growing over 8% year-over-year. In addition, the company is cutting its original full-year guidance for 2024. Starbucks CFO Rachel Ruggeri discussed the latest earnings report, what the company plans to change, and ongoing headwinds for the company. Ruggeri said, ""We had a strong quarter in Q1, and it was really driven by our most loyal customers remaining engaged across the globe. And so as we think about going forward ... what we're really focused on is continuing to drive customers into our rewards program."" Boeing (00:01:29) Boeing (BA) narrowed its fourth-quarter losses as outlined in its latest earnings results, but is withholding 2024 guidance amid questions surrounding the manufacturing of its 737 Max 9 jet series. Melius Research Managing Director of Aerospace, Defense & Space Robert Spingarn broke down the implications for Boeing. Spingarn said, ""The fact that there's no guide here isn't really a suspension so far as I can tell ... The FAA has asked for a freeze on the 737, arguably the most important product they do. And I think they're just being smart and not trying to get ahead of the regulator."" Novo Nordisk (00:01:47) Novo Nordisk (NVO) reported a 36% surge in sales thanks to high demand for weight loss drugs Wegovy and Ozempic. Novo Nordisk CFO Karsten Munk Knudsen discussed the company’s results and what it has in store in the coming months. Knudsen said, ""We are really happy and very proud about the results we delivered this morning. Being able to grow the company by 36% is historic in our context and in an industrial context."" Qualcomm (00:02:08) Qualcomm (QCOM) posted its first-quarter earnings results, revealing a quarterly revenue of $9.94 billion, $6.69 billion of which came from its handsets division, a 16% increase year-over-year. Qualcomm Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer Akash Palkhiwala discussed the chipmaker's performance, the current transition to AI-based tech, and China's economic environment. Palkhiwala said, ""When people buy a new phone, they're buying a more expensive phone. And so we are seeing this tremendous make shift towards more expensive devices, towards more expensive chips. And that shows up in our revenue growth."" Meta (00:02:21) Meta Platforms outpaced Wall Street estimates for its fourth-quarter earnings, posting $40.1 billion in revenue and earnings of $5.33 per share. Seaport Global Analyst Aaron Kessler discussed Meta's earnings and its guidance around pivots into AI. Kessler said, ""Obviously investors are going to like that showing continued expense discipline on their part. And so I think investors are really more focused on the guidance and the dividend for Meta."" Amazon (00:02:36) Amazon reported its fourth-quarter earnings, beating Wall Street estimates with $170 billion in revenue versus an expected $166.2 billion. Wedbush Securities Managing Director Scott Devitt broke down the results and the performance of the online retailer's various segments and business properties. Devitt said, ""At $13.2 billion, which is what they did in the quarter, you have a trajectory that's leading the company towards kind of a 10% bogey in 2025 now, which is not something that investors were expecting."" Apple (00:02:50) Apple's first-quarter earnings results blew past Wall Street estimates, posting over $119.5 billion in revenue and adjusted earnings per share of $2.18. However, net sales across Apple's categories and devices fell below expectations, particularly in its services and performance in China. Manhattan Venture Partners Head of Research Santosh Rao discussed Apple's sales miss and how Apple will proceed in generative AI investments. Rao said, ""The number is a miss overall, but I think it's not a major disaster because it's all about the future here going forward, how they get the generative AI into their whole mix and all that. So there are a lot of other levers that they can pull, but at this point it is definitely a disappointment that two areas that we were concerned about did disappoint.""",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=21382b94e15f34226a0b907b7175103a5fe8e080a9bef2ded477a654f8134813

The company’s stock price is on a massive bull run, rocketing 380% since the end of 2022, and was the best performing component of the S&P 500 in 2023. With that said, here are three things we’ll be watching for when the chip giant announces its fourth quarter earnings on Feb. 21. #1 Artificial Intelligence: Nvidia is the tech industry’s go-to provider for the powerful graphics processing units used to train and run generative AI models. Heck, Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that his company will purchase an incredible 350,000 Nvidia H100 cards by the end of 2024 at a price tag well into the billions of dollars. Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Tesla (TSLA), you name it, every company is clamoring for Nvidia’s chips. And those are just the tech giants. Smaller firms are also working to get their mitts on Nvidia’s offerings. And with the earnings season already showing continued AI investment across the tech industry, Nvidia stands to continue to gain considerably. #2 Market Expectations - Expectations for Nvidia’s fourth quarter are sky high after the company stunned Wall Street in the prior period when revenue rocked an incredible 206% year-over-year to $18.12 billion. In the fourth quarter, the company is projecting revenue of $20 billion plus or minus 2%, well above analysts’ prior expectations of $17.8 billion. And Wall Street doesn’t see the growth stopping anytime soon. Bank of America recently raised its price target on Nvidia price target to $800 from $700. Goldman Sachs also raised its target for the company to $800. It previously had a price target of $625 on the stock. #3 Regulation & Competition: Still, it’s not all smooth sailing for Nvidia. The company is contending with U.S. export restrictions blocking the sale of some of its high-end chips to China, one of its largest markets. And while that isn’t hurting the company for now, it could mean the chip giant misses out on potential future sales. Then there are its rivals: AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC) are slowly but surely building out their own high-powered AI chips, with AMD, in particular, gaining on Nvidia’s tail. That company says its latest MI300X chip can go toe-to-toe with Nvidia’s H100, a claim Nvidia refuted via a blog post. Nvidia’s own customers including Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and Tesla (TSLA) are also building out their own AI chips, which could cut into the total addressable market for third-party AI chips. Still, those threats are relatively distant at this point. Nvidia is still riding high at the moment. And we’ll find out it can keep the hype train rolling when it reports its results Feb. 21.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=e57129573f198a75a8e82521ef098cc2151fba041fbf7e64124d6a113c5d27d6

In 2023, the company generated nearly $27 billion in revenue, and its market value is well over $1 trillion. Let's take a closer look at what led to Nvidia's boom with Beyond the Ticker, where we dive into the company's biggest moments. 1993 Nvidia was founded on April 5, 1993, by Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem, with a vision to bring 3D graphics to the gaming industry. 1997 Nvidia launched its first hit product, the NV3. It would later go on to sell a whopping 1 million units in its first four months of availability. 1999 On January 22, 1999, Nvidia went public via IPO at $12 per share. 2000 Microsoft (MSFT) chose Nvidia to develop the graphics hardware for the first Xbox console. 2005 Microsoft rival Sony (SONY) chose Nvidia’s hardware to power the PlayStation 3. 2010 Nvidia became the graphics chip supplier for automaker Audi. 2015 The company launched its Nvidia Drive chip for powering driver assistance systems. 2016 Nvidia kicked off its AI efforts with the launch of its DGX-1 server for artificial intelligence applications. 2018 The company debuted the NVIDIA RTX, the first GPU capable of real-time ray tracing. That same year, Google (GOOG, GOOGL) announced it was using Nvidia’s Tesla (TSLA) P4 graphics cards for its Google Cloud Platform. 2022 Nvidia debuted its H100 graphics chip for AI, which still stands as one of the world’s most powerful chips for artificial intelligence apps. 2023 In May 2023, Nvidia eclipsed the $1 trillion market cap mark, joining the ranks of mega companies like Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft. The stock continues to surpass its all-time highs over the past month and is currently trading at over $700 per share. From a company of three engineers working on a graphics card, to thousands of employees working on chips that will power the AI supercomputers of the future, Nvidia remains at the top of the tech industry. From tech giants to retail titans, Beyond the Ticker is a historical series that takes a deep dive into some of Wall Street's trending companies and how they transformed into the financial icons they are today.

The move is a shift in Microsoft's previous strategy and a push to end what has been seen as ""console wars"". Lewis Ward, IDC Research Director of Gaming, joins the Live show alongside Yahoo Finance Tech Editor Dan Howley to discuss the latest development for Microsoft and what it could mean for the gaming sector moving forward. Giving more detail on the announcement, Ward states: ""I think there was a large share of Xbox players who were concerned that a lot of the crown jewels of the Xbox game studios are going to be eventually playable on Playstation 5, and so that was the thing that really caused a lot of consternation, let's say, among the Xbox fanbase. But Phil Spencer and company really tamped that down by saying, no, this is a limited approach that we're taking with four specific games that are a few years old at least. They are successful games... so the idea is to basically monetize a sunken investment at this point, and if they put it on PS5 and Switch, they're going to go to both by the end of this year, It's going to be... several million dollars more coming into the Xbox ecosystem.""

However, Financial Futurist Dave Nadig, says many are ""overdone"" in mega-caps like Nvidia (NVDA) and Meta (META) which drive gains. He warns of ""concentration risks,"" noting that in the Technology Select Spdr Fund (XLK) just 5 names account for more than 50% of the fund. Nadig advises those investing in tech to ""look for strategies that are a little bit more equal-weighted."" He suggests something like the Robo Global Robotics and Automation Index ETF (ROBO) which is ""much more balanced"" with global diversification across use cases. Many tech ETFs have ""hyper-concentrated"" portfolios, with stocks like Microsoft (MSFT), for example, dominating the top holdings. On the days that dominate stock does well, ""performance will beat everybody else,"" while down days see similar exaggerated moves. Nadig recommends focusing on long-term plays that ""benefit over the cycle, not just over the headline."" Beyond tech, Nadig highlights healthcare as an attractive sector, suggesting the Simplify Healthcare ETF (PINK) for exposure without ""veering entirely"" into biotech/pharma - providing ""nice balance.""

He notes the Magnificent Seven valuations have diverged ""drastically,"" causing investors to ""differentiate"" between them rather than treat them as a uniform group. As growth moderates for these mega-cap stocks, O'Rourke expects ""rotation"" within the Magnificent Seven tech companies as investors compare valuations and future trajectories.

As the S&P 500 (^GSPC) sets new records and ""Magnificent Seven"" trades such as Nvidia (NVDA) sail past red to white hot, remember to keep an even keel, advised life and business strategist Tony Robbins. ""If a Ferrari was on sale for 70% off, you'd buy it. But when your favorite stock is, people freak out. And when the thing is too expensive, they want to buy it,"" Robbins told Yahoo Finance. ""It's the crazy part of humanity."" Long-term fortunes are not built on a single asset class, let alone a single industry. Diversification is key to wealth generation, said Robbins, who has interviewed the likes of billionaires Ray Dalio, Robert Smith, and Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK-A, BRK-B) Warren Buffett. His latest book, ""The Holy Grail of Investing,"" digs into the power of alternative assets in a world obsessed with stocks. ""There [are] 250,000 companies that are from a $100 million to $3 billion [in value] that private equity can step into,"" said Robbins. ""Instead of trying to evaluate [the Magnificent Seven], create the diversification for yourself. So you reduce your risk by 80%."" His other tip for success includes turning a consumer mindset into an investor mindset: Those iPhone upgrades will cost you thousands, but a pile of Apple (AAPL) stock can set you up for the future. And regardless of where you're sitting in life, staying hungry can turn a losing tide — or extend a winning streak. ""If you're hungry, you'll find the answers. If you're hungry, you'll push through,"" said Robbins.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=e227da5b8357eced0d902d8b61e36e9e056eade0d8a9c564090c9d5737ffa139

But are there opportunities in the sector for other companies to make an intervention? Constellation Research founder and analyst R ""Ray"" Wang and TD Cowen managing director and senior equity research analyst John Blackledge join the Live show to discuss the future of the Magnificent Seven tech stocks and what investors need to keep in mind with so many possibilities in the sector. While Apple (AAPL) has made forays into generative AI, investors say they want more. Wang, however, sees existing potential, such as the expansion of Apple Ferret, an open-source machine learning model, and Apple chips with built-in AI. He signals that the recent regulations levied against Apple rom the Europe Union might affect AI stocks moving forward: ""The challenge with AI and regulatory bodies is this is the opportunity for an aspiring politician to save the world and help us with privacy and stop big tech. And without understanding the cost/benefit analysis of what they're going up against. So you are going to see a lot more regulatory pressure and headwinds that are going to affect a lot of these tech companies, especially as government wants to get involved in the regulatory aspect of AI because tech is one of the few industries that is so lightly regulated compared to everything else."" Blackledge elaborates on the nature of competition between tech companies in their pursuit of generative AI: ""Microsoft (MSFT) and OpenAI clearly won the headline battle last year for sure. Alphabet (GOOG,GOOGL), as far as I was tracking, right, probably in February, March, start to go faster with it. They had some good announcements in IO last year, last May. Obviously we're talking about the Gemini launch and it is going to be a little bit uneven but I do believe it's there for them to do well and to benefit like I was saying earlier with their cloud business, for enterprises and small business, and then with their Gemini suite of products for consumers. I agree, we've heard from all of our companies have reported. They're all using generative AI across their companies for internal functions and what not. We think Alphabet will be there for it. The pressure is definitely on."" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.

Aguilar highlights a notable shift in the mega-cap tech sector, transitioning from being ""a momentum trade to a fundamental trade"" due to fading AI hype. He emphasizes that for these companies to deliver on future expectations, they will require significant capital expenditure and research and development investments. As expectations for these stocks remain elevated, ""investors are questioning"" whether the current levels of gains can be sustained over the long term. With the highly anticipated Consumer Price Index (CPI) data set for release Tuesday, Aguilar advises investors to ""expect more volatility.""

Macquarie Senior Media Tech Analyst Tim Nollen joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss how AI can help advertising companies optimize their budgets. Nollen acknowledges that AI ""has been a factor for many years already"" in the advertising and media landscape. However, he also highlights the ""broader implications"" of language models like ChatGPT, which could fundamentally change how consumers perform searches. This shift could substantially impact search market revenue, which is already a $200 billion industry, Nollen explains. He notes AI could open up opportunities for advertisers who allocate ad spending to search engines, allowing them to diversify their budgets and explore alternative avenues. Nollen points to companies like AppLovin (APP) as potential beneficiaries: the company could leverage its data ""to make their automated ad buying platforms more effective,"" potentially delivering higher ""returns on spending"" for advertisers.

Keybanc Managing Director of Software Equity Research Jackson Ader joins the Live show to discuss his call. What sets Microsoft apart from other tech names is its AI monetization abilities, Adler highlights.

In Keybanc surveys, Adler continues, CIOs claim Microsoft has AI capabilities that are ""superior"" over other vendors: ""Customers are saying this is where we want to go for AI,"" Adler concludes.
