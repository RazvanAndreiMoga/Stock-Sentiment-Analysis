Meta has high hopes for the role of artificial intelligence in advertising, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg saying on a recent earnings call that “AI is going to change advertising in a big way.” Meta Head of Global Business Nicola Mendelsohn joins Yahoo Finance Live at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland to discuss the incorporation of AI in advertising and how the company is leveraging AI for advertisers. Mendelsohn states that current AI tools in its Meta Advantage suite have assisted in “really significant growth for advertisers"" who have seen “better targeting and better performance.” Mendelsohn sees a “cautious optimism” from advertisers who utilized internet advertising less in 2023. According to Mendelsohn, access to tools are not limited to size, noting: “It’s always been about the democratization of digital marketing,” with companies of all sizes utilizing features such as reels for advertising.With the upcoming presidential election, Mendelsohn states the company is “constantly working out what our [Meta’s] playbook is,” in terms of political advertising regulations—not just in the US but globally. It's all part of Yahoo Finance's exclusive coverage from the World Economic Forum in Davos, where our team is speaking to top decision-makers as well as preeminent leaders in business, finance, and politics about the world’s most pressing issues and priorities for the coming year.

Here are some of the highlights. Former Microsoft President & CEO Bill Gates (00:00:03) Former Microsoft (MSFT) President and CEO Bill Gates discusses how when there are new technologies, they can be used to achieve both positive and negative things. “AI can be used… for cyberattacks, it can be used to design a bioterrorism weapon…. Whenever we have new technologies, they’re used to achieve positive goals and… for some challenging things as well,” Gates notes. “When we computers, books, video games... we had to think… what’s the tasteful, appropriate use to just get the good and minimize those… negative things.” Nasdaq CEO & President Adena Friedman (00:00:31) Nasdaq (NDAQ) CEO and President Adena Friedman explains that “AI-driven companies, AI-enabled companies, and AI companies themselves, so those companies that can really help transform business, I think that those are the types of companies you’ll see more and more of coming out into the public markets.” Meta Head of Global Business Nicola Mendelsohn (00:00:49) Meta (META) Head of Global Business Nicola Mendelsohn discusses how Meta’s AI products have benefited advertisers. “Back in ’22, we brought together all of the products that we have that are actually powered by AI into our Meta Advantage suite. And what were seeing now, is that our advertisers on the whole are using at least one of those products. And the reason they’re doing that is because it’s giving them better targeting and better performance,” Mendelsohn explains. Verizon Chairman & CEO Hans Vestberg (00:01:14) Verizon (VZ) Chairman and CEO Hans Vestberg notes that “generative AI will be important for our... business.” “When it comes to AI, especially the generative AI and things like that, I think at the edge of the network it’s going to be very important to have AI to take quick decisions, very close to the... end use, to the customer or the enterprise.” Accenture CEO Julie Sweet (00:01:41) Accenture (ACN) CEO Julie Sweet explains “what’s really important is to understand how is the gen AI going to change your talent, what are the new skills, and then… how do you make sure that we can bring people along the journey to get those new jobs.” Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff (00:01:57) Salesforce (CRM) CEO Marc Benioff notes the “exciting opportunities” that come with AI. “I’m trying to tell stories and explain to customers what we’re seeing with AI. And I think that as we have been… traveling around we see so many exciting opportunities with AI that customers are going to get much higher margins,” Benioff says. “Right now AI can really… make people a lot better.” Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins (00:02:16) Cisco (CSCO) CEO Chuck Robbins discusses how AI will impact the company. “I think it’s incredibly early… with AI right now,” Robbins says. “As this AI thing explodes, my expectation is that our infrastructure equipment that goes with it, will also go up. KPMG US Chair & CEO Paul Knopp (00:02:26) KPMG US Chair & CEO Paul Knopp explains that “76 percent of millennials and Gen Z said that generative AI already impacts their professional lives in a big way and that they’re not concerned about job displacement. But I think that really means is they understand the technology and they also know that it’s the future. And that it’s actually mainstream at this point.” “It really is getting to the point where we’re nearing industrialization and a lot of companies are already using it in certain applications of their business,” Knopp adds. Novartis CEO Vasant Narasimhan (00:02:59) Novartis (NVS) CEO Vasant Narasimhan explains how AI will impact the company’s drug development. “Impacting the next five years, is how AI is going to impact many of our productivity efforts in drug development. How fast can we generate new trial protocols, how fast can we work with regulators, how fast can we look at patient safety, look at large patient data sets,” Narasimhan notes. “It is generative AI, but maybe not the most cutting-edge generative AI.” Vista Equity Partners Founder, Chairman, & CEO Robert Smith (00:03:18)  Vista Equity Partners Founder, Chairman, and CEO Robert Smith discusses how AI “is an enabling technology just like other enabling technologies have come and… ultimately been infused into the fabric of... our companies.” “We’ve been… engaging in artificial intelligence for… well over a decade and implementing those in products and solutions and services. Gen AI gives another gear to that,” Smith adds.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=25cdd4a233d65de784a88f14a30ffd3207131120bed7c336d09000ee2e6fceb9

Tech giants including Meta (META) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) are taking the lead and could very easily swallow the smaller stakeholders in the sector, specifically in the monetization of data.

Schneider notes that social and online media sites will instrument the first wave of data monetization, which involves training large language models, while the second wave focuses on more specific, “narrower” models that serve single functions. Large tech companies are ""the most data-hungry ones today,” Schneider explains, saying they are ""building the tools"" of the so-called AI revolution. Schneider goes on to say smaller companies will be able to innovate AI faster. For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.

What does this mean for those who invest in Meta or AI overall? KeyBanc Managing Director Justin Patterson joins Yahoo Finance to discuss what investors should be on the lookout for when considering investments in Meta, AI, and beyond. Patterson explains what investors should expect from Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg: ""One would be just fleshing out this AI strategy some more, so Mark in his comments teased, expect more to come. We will have the latest model Llama 3 being worked on over the course of the year. There was some teasing of more connected devices in there."" He continues ""The other side would just be, what is the health of the core ad platform right now?

For Meta (META), Niles calls the valuation ""compelling,"" adding that the platform will likely get a boost from election year advertising spending.  For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.

The hearing was fiery & confrontational, with the parents of victims amongst the attendees in the audience. Here are the top takeaways investors need to know:  Victims state their case (00:00:12):  Republican Senator from Illinois Dick Durbin opened the hearing with a harrowing video, where victims detailed how they were sexually exploited on the various social media platforms. The video also included parents who had lost their children from suicide due to the bullying and harassment they experienced online. It was a strong opening salvo for the Judiciary Committee that immediately put the tech CEOs on the back foot.  Senator Klobuchar vs. Discord CEO Jason Citron (00:01:13) Democratic Senator from Minnesota Amy Klobuchar took on Discord CEO Jason Citron on whether or not he would support her legislation titled The Shield Act. The law would criminalize the nonconsensual sharing of intimate images online. Without a firm answer from Mr. Citron, the Senator erupted in frustration: ""I just want to get this stuff done, I am so tired of this it's been 28 years since the Internet and we haven't passed any of these bills? Everyone is double-talk, double-talk, it's time to actually pass them. And the reason they haven't passed is because of the power of your companies.""  Mark Zuckerberg confronted by grieving families (00:01:29) Meta (META) founder & CEO Mark Zuckerberg was ambushed during the hearing when Republican Senator from Missouri, Josh Hawley, prompted Zuckerberg to apologize to the victims & families in the audience. Hawley stated ""There are families of victims here today, would you like to apologize to them now? They're here, you are on national television, would you like to apologize to the families who were harmed by your product?"" Zuckerberg promptly stood up and addressed the families of the victims as they held up photos of their loved ones. Zuckerberg addressed the audience saying: ""I'm sorry for everything you have all been through. No one should go through the things that your families have suffered.""  Although the hearing resulted in many dynamic and powerful moments, it is not clear whether any legislation will be passed against the social media giants. However, it seems that if there is any sort of bipartisan issue still left in Congress, regulation of social media is something both parties can work across the aisle on accomplishing.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=487a829349924711e935d44ea6a80abd9592a14e97ccd49623458edae9f4294e

Horwitz said there's ""a consensus"" on the need for platforms to invest more and ""be more thoughtful in their feature designs"" to improve protections. However, he questioned whether the current Congress is ""well-suited to this field of regulation"" given the number of older membership. Horwitz highlighted Meta research revealing ""known"" and ""foreseeable"" mental health risks from using their platforms under ""certain circumstances.""

(SNAP) is the latest company to announce layoffs, saying it will cut 10% of its global staff. The company plans to use the capital to invest in long-term growth plans. With stiff competition for ad revenue from Meta (META) and Pinterest (PINS) what must Snap do in order to succeed? Roth MKM Managing Director Rohit Kulkarni joins Yahoo Finance to discuss the company's performance, as well as what the company needs to fix in order to achieve some of those long-term growth plans and better engage with its competition. In terms of competition, Kulkarni explains that ""What Facebook has done since, say, late '21, all of '22, and half of '23, they have invested in AI in a way that they can recover some of the lost signals from all of the changes that Apple and all the privacy changes that have been happening in the ecosystem. I would put it that Facebook is probably maybe 6, 9, 12 months ahead of a company like Snap when it comes to fixing what was broken because of Apple and ecosystem changes... Snap is facing its own issues. They're losing a lot of executives. They are losing some key people on the team, and while that is happening, they're falling a little bit behind on they're kind of quest to become a direct response.""

The company’s stock price is on a massive bull run, rocketing 380% since the end of 2022, and was the best performing component of the S&P 500 in 2023. With that said, here are three things we’ll be watching for when the chip giant announces its fourth quarter earnings on Feb. 21. #1 Artificial Intelligence: Nvidia is the tech industry’s go-to provider for the powerful graphics processing units used to train and run generative AI models. Heck, Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that his company will purchase an incredible 350,000 Nvidia H100 cards by the end of 2024 at a price tag well into the billions of dollars. Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Tesla (TSLA), you name it, every company is clamoring for Nvidia’s chips. And those are just the tech giants. Smaller firms are also working to get their mitts on Nvidia’s offerings. And with the earnings season already showing continued AI investment across the tech industry, Nvidia stands to continue to gain considerably. #2 Market Expectations - Expectations for Nvidia’s fourth quarter are sky high after the company stunned Wall Street in the prior period when revenue rocked an incredible 206% year-over-year to $18.12 billion. In the fourth quarter, the company is projecting revenue of $20 billion plus or minus 2%, well above analysts’ prior expectations of $17.8 billion. And Wall Street doesn’t see the growth stopping anytime soon. Bank of America recently raised its price target on Nvidia price target to $800 from $700. Goldman Sachs also raised its target for the company to $800. It previously had a price target of $625 on the stock. #3 Regulation & Competition: Still, it’s not all smooth sailing for Nvidia. The company is contending with U.S. export restrictions blocking the sale of some of its high-end chips to China, one of its largest markets. And while that isn’t hurting the company for now, it could mean the chip giant misses out on potential future sales. Then there are its rivals: AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC) are slowly but surely building out their own high-powered AI chips, with AMD, in particular, gaining on Nvidia’s tail. That company says its latest MI300X chip can go toe-to-toe with Nvidia’s H100, a claim Nvidia refuted via a blog post. Nvidia’s own customers including Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and Tesla (TSLA) are also building out their own AI chips, which could cut into the total addressable market for third-party AI chips. Still, those threats are relatively distant at this point. Nvidia is still riding high at the moment. And we’ll find out it can keep the hype train rolling when it reports its results Feb. 21.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=e57129573f198a75a8e82521ef098cc2151fba041fbf7e64124d6a113c5d27d6

This stems from concerns over state laws enacted by Florida and Texas that would stop social media platforms from supposedly suppressing certain political content. The ruling may have major implications for how state governments may regulate how social media platforms moderate their content. Sinan Aral, Author of The Hype Machine and Professor at MIT Sloan Management, joins Yahoo Finance to discuss the social media case before the Supreme Court, how it may play out, and the implications of its potential rulings. When asked how the Supreme Court may lean, Aral says: ""I think the justices are skeptical of these laws. I don't imagine that these two laws are going to be upheld in their entirety. I think that either they're going to be overturned or the cases are going to be remanded for further development in the lower courts. And the reason why that would happen is precisely the threading the needle that I discussed earlier, which is that the Supreme Court is likely to want to bound the impact of their decision... You saw them asking questions about exactly what are the boundaries of the scope of these laws and therefore their decisions about these laws. At the end of the day, it's going to be about content moderation and how much of it is the purview of social media companies or not.""

He warns of ""concentration risks,"" noting that in the Technology Select Spdr Fund (XLK) just 5 names account for more than 50% of the fund. Nadig advises those investing in tech to ""look for strategies that are a little bit more equal-weighted."" He suggests something like the Robo Global Robotics and Automation Index ETF (ROBO) which is ""much more balanced"" with global diversification across use cases. Many tech ETFs have ""hyper-concentrated"" portfolios, with stocks like Microsoft (MSFT), for example, dominating the top holdings. On the days that dominate stock does well, ""performance will beat everybody else,"" while down days see similar exaggerated moves. Nadig recommends focusing on long-term plays that ""benefit over the cycle, not just over the headline."" Beyond tech, Nadig highlights healthcare as an attractive sector, suggesting the Simplify Healthcare ETF (PINK) for exposure without ""veering entirely"" into biotech/pharma - providing ""nice balance.""

However, their dominant run may be ending, according to JonesTrading Chief Market Strategist Mike O'Rourke. O'Rourke pointed to recent earnings from Meta (META) and Nvidia (NVDA) that ""shattered"" expectations yet saw different market reactions. He notes the Magnificent Seven valuations have diverged ""drastically,"" causing investors to ""differentiate"" between them rather than treat them as a uniform group. As growth moderates for these mega-cap stocks, O'Rourke expects ""rotation"" within the Magnificent Seven tech companies as investors compare valuations and future trajectories. He believes this could force funds into other promising areas of the market beyond the narrow mega-cap technology focus, like biotech and pharma.

As the S&P 500 (^GSPC) sets new records and ""Magnificent Seven"" trades such as Nvidia (NVDA) sail past red to white hot, remember to keep an even keel, advised life and business strategist Tony Robbins. ""If a Ferrari was on sale for 70% off, you'd buy it. But when your favorite stock is, people freak out. And when the thing is too expensive, they want to buy it,"" Robbins told Yahoo Finance. ""It's the crazy part of humanity."" Long-term fortunes are not built on a single asset class, let alone a single industry. Diversification is key to wealth generation, said Robbins, who has interviewed the likes of billionaires Ray Dalio, Robert Smith, and Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK-A, BRK-B) Warren Buffett. His latest book, ""The Holy Grail of Investing,"" digs into the power of alternative assets in a world obsessed with stocks. ""There [are] 250,000 companies that are from a $100 million to $3 billion [in value] that private equity can step into,"" said Robbins. ""Instead of trying to evaluate [the Magnificent Seven], create the diversification for yourself. So you reduce your risk by 80%."" His other tip for success includes turning a consumer mindset into an investor mindset: Those iPhone upgrades will cost you thousands, but a pile of Apple (AAPL) stock can set you up for the future. And regardless of where you're sitting in life, staying hungry can turn a losing tide — or extend a winning streak. ""If you're hungry, you'll find the answers. If you're hungry, you'll push through,"" said Robbins.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=e227da5b8357eced0d902d8b61e36e9e056eade0d8a9c564090c9d5737ffa139

But are there opportunities in the sector for other companies to make an intervention? Constellation Research founder and analyst R ""Ray"" Wang and TD Cowen managing director and senior equity research analyst John Blackledge join the Live show to discuss the future of the Magnificent Seven tech stocks and what investors need to keep in mind with so many possibilities in the sector. While Apple (AAPL) has made forays into generative AI, investors say they want more. Wang, however, sees existing potential, such as the expansion of Apple Ferret, an open-source machine learning model, and Apple chips with built-in AI. He signals that the recent regulations levied against Apple rom the Europe Union might affect AI stocks moving forward: ""The challenge with AI and regulatory bodies is this is the opportunity for an aspiring politician to save the world and help us with privacy and stop big tech. And without understanding the cost/benefit analysis of what they're going up against. So you are going to see a lot more regulatory pressure and headwinds that are going to affect a lot of these tech companies, especially as government wants to get involved in the regulatory aspect of AI because tech is one of the few industries that is so lightly regulated compared to everything else."" Blackledge elaborates on the nature of competition between tech companies in their pursuit of generative AI: ""Microsoft (MSFT) and OpenAI clearly won the headline battle last year for sure. Alphabet (GOOG,GOOGL), as far as I was tracking, right, probably in February, March, start to go faster with it. They had some good announcements in IO last year, last May. Obviously we're talking about the Gemini launch and it is going to be a little bit uneven but I do believe it's there for them to do well and to benefit like I was saying earlier with their cloud business, for enterprises and small business, and then with their Gemini suite of products for consumers. I agree, we've heard from all of our companies have reported. They're all using generative AI across their companies for internal functions and what not. We think Alphabet will be there for it. The pressure is definitely on."" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.

While some are excited, others point to the fact that the social media site isn't profitable, posting net losses of $90 million in 2023. Crunchbase News Senior Data Editor Gené Teare joins Yahoo Finance to discuss Reddit's upcoming IPO and what makes the platform unique in the social media sector. Teare lays out what the current sentiment for the stock is: ""I think the signals here are very mixed. I think some people feel like this is a little rich as a valuation. They're targeting I think on the upper end of about $6.4 billion, and that has us saying, if this is a company that can still grow 18 years in then it might not be so rich...Its revenues around $804 million last year and it did grow that 21%. So if it can keep growing its revenues then there is potential in the stock, but I think a lot of that revenue growth is more recent. So I think there's a lot of doubt around whether this is a little rich."" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.
