The firm argues that Palantir's valuation has become unsustainable on the back of an artificial intelligence boom that has not yet materialized. Jeffries Senior Analyst Brent Thill joins Yahoo Finance to discuss the reason for the move. While acknowledging Palantir has promising technology, Thill believes ""the hype is ahead of the reality."" He notes that while AI adoption will grow, ""AI is a driver, but it's gonna be a slower revenue materialization"" than the market expects for Palantir currently. Thill highlights software firms like Microsoft (MSFT) and Adobe (ADBE) which boast ""the best product line-ups"" spanning multiple sectors, not just an AI niche. For Palantir and similarly hyped names, he advises investors to wait until the AI hype wears off ""and then come back to these names at a lower level."" The downgrade is a reality check that Palantir's value may have become inflated beyond reasonability in anticipation of an AI boom that has yet to emerge.

Digital content is really the way that enterprises need to engage their customers and drive and grow their business, and this is a single solution and application that they can do all of those five stages on."" Wadhwani also comments on the copyright environment for content borne by AI, and the marketing and use of this content through the newly announced Adobe GenStudio.
